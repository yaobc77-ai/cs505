On July 20, Sweden's Patent & Market Court asserted that Booking.com's narrow price parity clauses (which dictate that a hotel cannot offer a better price on its own website than on the OTA) had the potential effect of restricting competition in the online travel market. The case is significant due to its going further than the national competition authorities in Sweden, Italy and France, who in 2015 accepted Booking.com's commitment to narrow rather than wide price parity clauses. (Wide price parity means that a hotel cannot offer a cheaper price than the OTA on any channel). The Swedish hospitality association Visita has maintained since that time that narrow parity clauses do not go far enough to reduce the anti-competitive effect Booking.com has on the hotel market. This latest victory could lay the groundwork for other countries following suit. We spoke to David Nordström, Senior Economist at Copenhagen Economics (the consultancy who advised Visita on the case). We asked David to explain the background of the case, as well as how they managed to take on one of the biggest companies in Europe - and win. Triptease: Could you explain how you approached this anti-competition case with Visita? David: We've been assisting Visita since the start of this process back in 2015, when they found that the narrow price parity accepted by the Swedish Competition Authority was not going far enough to remove anti-competition concerns from the hotel market in Sweden. In 2016 Visita went to the Patent & Market Court and asked them to order Booking.com to remove price parity clauses between their website and hotels' own web pages. In our role as Visita's economic consultancy, we provided expert analysis of four different areas in order to support their case. The first focused on the competitive pressure between OTAs and the hotel's own web page. The second was on the anti-competitive effects of narrow price parity. We argued that, inter alia, since the cost of sale for hotels in Sweden currently is much cheaper on their own website compared to on an OTA, hotels lack incentives to price lower on OTAs than on their own web page. Thus, narrow parity clauses force hotels to always price the same on their own web page as on an OTA. The third expert report was on the effect that the 2014 ruling had on hotel prices and commission rates in the following years. The fourth report was a rebuttal of the price differentiation evidence that Booking.com submitted to the court. They were arguing that the level of price differentiation between OTAs was significant, which went against our view. We contested this argument by building our own web scraping tool that would show us the differences between hotel rates on different websites. We found that, even though hotels were not choosing to differentiate their prices, errors and lags on metasearch sites were causing different rates to show for the same hotel from different suppliers. This was therefore not a true price differentiation. Triptease: What were the court's reasons for ruling in Visita's favor? David: After we presented our expert arguments and Booking.com made a series of rebuttals, the court considered and then ruled on July 20 that they followed Visita's claims in their entirety. The court's first finding was that narrow price parity restricted competition between different OTAs by raising the barriers to entry to the market. The reason for this is because the difference between OTA commission rates and direct booking costs means that hotels would always choose to price lowest on their own booking channel. Narrow price parity obviously restricts this, which means that potential new OTAs struggle to enter the market and compete on the basis of low commissions. Hotels would always price down to the same rate, and then they would have to also lower the price on Booking.com - removing any price differentiation between Booking.com and the new OTA. Secondly, the court found that narrow price parity clauses restricted price competition for hotel rooms, as there was clearly a lot of evidence that without the clauses hotels would provide lower prices on their own websites. This was sufficient for the court to conclude that Booking.com's clause had at least potential anti-competitive effects. Triptease: Did the court find any justifications at all for narrow price parity? David: The court did consider whether there was any justification for the clauses. Booking.com had argued quite strongly that they needed the clauses to avoid hotels 'freeriding' on them. They contested that they would turn into just a 'search and compare' site for users to look at before always booking on the hotel's own site. Booking.com argued that this would mean they would lose their commission and disappear. The court did not really find any support for that argument. Triptease: Could you explain in more detail what you found regarding price differentiation on different websites? David: Booking.com had produced a report using a top-down approach to show that if you looked at metasearch sites, there was a lot of price differentiation between OTAs - i.e. hotels were pricing differently on different websites. To investigate this, we used a bottom-up approach by setting up a controlled experiment where we tracked ten Swedish hotels as they changed their prices across different channels. As we all know, the process of updating hotel prices online is reasonably complex, with a lot of different systems involved. Nobody we spoke to seemed to have a completely clear idea of how the metasearch engines were pulling their particular prices either. We hypothesized that due to how many stages there were in the process of changing a price, false price differentiation could be observed due to various lags in the system. This indeed proved to be a source of error, but one that we found tended to level out in around 30 minutes or so. The other thing we found, however, was that Booking.com were comparing apples and pears. If you just take the lowest price on e.g. TripAdvisor for two OTAs they may not be for the same type of room. Without controlling for this you would compare the price for a twin bedroom on Booking.com with a king size room from Expedia. This meant there was an artificially high level of price differentiation observed. Triptease: Do you think this case was particular to the Swedish market, or is it transferable? David: To quite a large extent, I think it is a transferable case. Booking.com are obviously present across Europe and they're usually on of the largest OTAs in a country's market. A peculiarity of the Swedish market that might be not very transferable to others is that in Sweden, you have a large proportion of the hotel market represented by hotel chains. These chains obviously have their own sophisticated websites which are usually an important source of revenue. This may make the industry more sensitive to restrictions on pricing on their website than in other markets where this is not the case and where a lot of hotels might not even have their own website and booking engine. Triptease: The European Commission have been investigating OTAs off-and-on; why do you think these cases are coming country-by-country and not from the Commission as a whole? David: That's a very good question. Usually, when you have these types of cases that stretch across several member states you would expect the Commission to intervene. In this case, the Commission felt that the issue was most appropriately handled through the European Competition Network, which was the case for, amongst others, Sweden, France and Italy.

The governors are always interested to receive feedback from parents and carers and one environment this can be done is at Parent Evenings. You will find governors in attendence at most Parents Evenings, and we will be there primarily to listen to your feedback. This could be on any aspect of college life, however, we will generally have a number of specific questions relevant to the stage that your child is at in their College life. Answering these will help us to judge how well the College is meeting the overall needs of your child. We will take views gathered from these events back to the Stakeholder Engagement Committee and report any recurring themes to the Full Governing Body. We will generally be identified on the evenings by wearing identification badges, however, if you cannot find a governor on the evening please do ask a member of staff and we look forward to meeting you. From time to time there are situations that arise that need addressing appropriately but effectively, and sometimes there is a natural instinct “to go to the top” to seek an immediate remedy. In these cases some people might presume that making contact with a governor or the chair of governors is the most effective way to sort things out. The reality is almost always that issues need to be resolved by the most appropriate person and this is not normally a governor. There are clear lines of communication and resolution of issues laid out in the College Complaints Policy and the final step will involve representation to the Chair of Governors. Students (and parents of students) should take up their issues with the staff member most closely familiar with the matter; this will usually be the class teacher or form tutor, but if the matter needs to then be resolved at a higher level the department head or similar line manager should be contacted. In situations that are more serious and require a greater intervention or resolution the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) or Head Teacher should be made aware and a meeting arranged. In the final situation you may wish to make representation to the Chair of Governors if you feel that the matter has not been handled appropriately; this would need to be in writing and in accordance with the guidelines set out in the Complaints Policy.
I’ve found heaven on earth and that place is the Bonneville Salt Flats. A bold statement, I know, but when you see the imagery from this wondrous, magical place, I think you might agree. I was recently in Salt Lake City for a conference, and had the opportunity to stay in Utah for the weekend. It also happened to be at the same time as Sundance. I knew the stars were aligned— this trip was going to be amazing and full of gram-worthy moments. It did not disappoint. I had never heard of the Salt Flats until recently, when my fellow Visceral Vision-er mentioned seeing them during her cross country trip from New York to California. After some more research, I found out that they’re in Utah and only 1.5 hours away from Salt Lake City. Serendipity at its best, don’t you think? As a lifestyle photographer that loves nature, I was equal parts excited and nervous about photographing the Bonneville Salt Flats. What if I can’t fully capture its beauty with my camera? While I know I should be present and enjoy the moment, I also felt a lot of pressure to be able to able to produce some epic shots. Travel photographer Emilie Ristevski, who I admire greatly, described it perfectly when she said, “It is a love/hate aspect of the job, as a large part of what I do is purely focused around capturing imagery or a moment. My mind often gets stuck in this mood, always observing and looking at a location through a lens.” And so I did a lot of Googling, looking for tips for shooting the salt flats. To my dismay, there wasn’t much there. There was a TON of info about shooting cars on the salt flats, as they act as a speedway during the summer months for big races, but nothing about photographing the landscape itself. Also, not much about getting there, weather, conditions, etc. So pretty much I had no “pro-tips” and pressure was fu***** on. The only thing I knew was that I had to get there by either sunrise or sunset. It didn’t make sense for us to go for sunset due to the fact that we planned to go to Sundance later, so sunrise it was. And boy, was it the right decision. This is going to sound a little crazy, but I used three different apps (magic hour, native iOS weather app, sun finder) to see what time sunrise was expected to be. Need confirmation from multiple sources, of course. Sunrise was due to be at 7:45am or so, with magic hour starting at around 7:15am. For reference, we went in the winter, specifically on January 23rd, 2016. We dragged our butts out of bed at 4:30am to leave by 5:30am or so. The trip is almost exactly 1.5 hrs west of Salt Lake City, so we got there right around 7:10am. There are a few different points to view the flats, and I would recommend the route we took. We got off at Exit 4 on I-80 in Utah and headed north. We took the first right on Salt Flats road and just headed down the road until there’s no more road to drive on (check out this map). Once you get out of your car, you will be surrounded by the flats. It is epic. You could drive onto the flats, but we had a rental car and didn’t want to risk it. We walked a little bit and reached the water. We were extremely lucky as it had rained two days before, so by the time we got to the flats, there was just enough water to create the mirror effect that I so desired, without us trudging through several feet of water. It was fate. The sun began to peek right from behind the mountains, and it was absolutely breathtaking. It first began as a blazing, fiery orange and then slowly melted into purple and pink pastels, and finally a blue/grey sky. What’s amazing about the flats is that different angles give you completely different pictures. It’s like being in multiple places at once. At one side, you have the bold sunrise. On the other side, it’s a serene mountainscape tinged with pale blue. After we gorged on photos at this point, we moved to a different spot for photographs. Closer to the highway exit is a rest stop that completely overlooks the flat. We headed there at around 8am, before the sun began to blow out pictures. The only thing that we didn’t quite plan out too well is that if you go on the way back from the flats, you’re on the “wrong” side of the rest stop. A road and the other rest stop obstruct your view. So be prepared to run like a maniac across the street to get the rest stop with the epic view. Why we ran? There was no good place to drive and turn around. You’ve been warned. After spending our morning at what felt like heaven, or at least something otherworldly fourth dimension, we happily headed to Park City and was ready for Sundance by noon. Seeing the salt flats was truly something I will never forget. The dreamy beauty of the flats were unreal, and a great reminder of how amazing nature is. It’s especially meaningful to me because I’m always stuck behind a computer and attached to technology, so this reminder of well, the world, made a lasting impression on me. Due to lack of information found during my research, I am also sharing all the details of our visit in hopes that it will help you in the future. Regarding the equipment that I shot with, I was using a Canon 6D, Sigma 35mm f1.4 ART lens, Canon 17-35mm f2.8 lens, and a tripod. I shot mostly at iso 400, f7.0-f11.0. For portraits, I shot around f2.0 to f2.2. I shot manually and underexposed a few notches to ensure that the photos wouldn’t be too blown out. Oh… and I MADE MY FIRST VIDEO. Literally, I’ve never used the video capability on this sucker until now. When I was there, I was suddenly struck with inspiration to press that record button, and knew that I had to film it so you could get the full experience. And along that vein, this is also the first video I’ve ever edited. I had no idea what I was doing, and still don’t know what I’m doing, really. But I am learning. So bear with me while I delve into this new world of videography. However, I was lucky in that the subject matter was so beautiful that I feel it detracts from the amateur filmmaking. Enjoy! I love this post! Your video really captures the beauty of those salt flats. Can’t wait to see more videos from you in the future!! Beautiful!!!!! Which month did you visit? This was in January during the Sundance festival. It can certainly be combined for a fun trip! You have inspired us to make the trip this year – and perhaps every year henceforth. There is a webcam (google: bonneville saltflats webcam) so one can time the trip when reflections are in play. I hope the area remains pristine but your photos will attract those who cannot fly to Bolivia. I daresay it’s every bit as good as the shots I’ve seen of Lake Uyumi. Gorgeous Pictures! And thanks for all the information on getting there!

The NRHA Foundations of Leadership Program features six modules that are focused on helping students recognize their leadership and communication styles so they can become better, more effective leaders in their operations.
COLUMBUS — Two snaps are all it takes to tell whether Ohio State is ready or not defensively. One week, it was a long touchdown hinting that trouble was on the way for the Buckeyes at Maryland. The next it was Malik Harrison flying in for a sack that signaled the Silver Bullets meant business against Michigan. With a full regular season in the rearview mirror, by now it’s well established that Ohio State has yet to ever truly establish any consistency from game to game on that side of the football. But when the Buckeyes bring their best stuff like they did last weekend in The Game, it’s clear they have more than enough potential to pressure the quarterback, generate turnovers and carry enough weight to balance the offense and make the program a legitimate national-title contender. And after a couple snaps on Saturday night in Indianapolis against Northwestern, it might be clear by then whether or not the Buckeyes will have that shot in the College Football Playoff. “We’re making progress,” Ohio State coach Urban Meyer said. “The pass defense is bothering a lot of people [when it is] giving up plays. I thought the rush defense and our linebackers played very well Saturday. Our defensive line, you felt like you kind of controlled the game with the defensive line. Northwestern hasn’t been much of a scoring threat this season and comes into the matchup having put up fewer points than any team from the Big Ten West Division. But if there’s a strength for the Wildcats with the football, it’s throwing the football. Ohio State has had some well-documented issues giving up deep shots and struggling with pass interference penalties, and that even popped up again at times against Michigan. Northwestern will surely be trying to test the Buckeyes down the field with a passing attack that finished No. 5 in the conference in yards per game, which will once again put the spotlight on a secondary that has obviously been as inconsistent as the rest of the defense. But Jordan Fuller and Brendon White both nabbed interceptions in The Game, part of an overall step forward for the defense as the Buckeyes claimed the East crown and moved on to the Big Ten title game in Indianapolis. Former Ohio State linebacker Zach Boren returned to the Lettermen Row film lab to look at the strengths and weaknesses of the Silver Bullets coming off that win and heading on to Indianapolis in his latest episode of BuckIQ.

The uncapped needle was in a position which the child could have easily stepped on it while getting out of the bed. The home had no running water due to late payments. Gibson-Herrin is charged with child neglect and possession of a controlled substance. She is being held in the Southern Regional Jail under a 25,000 dollar bond.
Gaze in wonder at the lofty spires of Hungary’s Parliament Building as it rises majestically above the Danube in Budapest. Sit down for friendly, intimate meals with farmers in Croatia and artists in Romania. Uncover scores of little-known treasures, including the picturesque Bulgarian hill towns of Veliko Tarnovo and Arbanassi and the surprising rock-hewn churches of Ivanovo—a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Step back in time to investigate the history and legends along the Danube while you cruise the Iron Gates. Tour Belgrade by bicycle, marvel at the massive People’s Palace in Bucharest or see Vlad the Impaler’s tomb in the Romanian countryside. From Budapest to Bucharest, Roman ruins to medieval fortresses, this journey will reveal the unstoppable resiliency of the human spirit, as well as the highlights of this spectacular region. The adventure of a lifetime awaits you. Explorers wishing to discover ancient lands and modern multicultural cities. Photographers, amateur archaeologists, connoisseurs of regional cuisines and anyone who loves beautiful and mysterious locales. Arrive at Bucharest Henri Coandă International Airport. If your cruise/tour package includes a group arrival transfer or if you have purchased a private arrival transfer, you will be greeted by a Uniworld representative and transferred to the hotel. Count Dracula might be a fictional character who makes the blood curdle on Halloween, but his historical namesake is not. Vlad III—known in his heyday as Dracula or “Vlad the Impaler”—was a medieval prince with a penchant for brutally punishing his enemies. Or was it all a smear campaign instigated by his enemies? Find out more today on a visit to his tomb. Also on the agenda—a guided tour of the infamous Ceausescu Mansion. Legend says that a tiny, verdant island in the midst of lovely Snagov Lake, just north of the city, contains Vlad the Impaler’s tomb. Vlad III, who ruled Wallachia (now part of modern Romania) in the 15th century, may have inspired Bram Stoker’s Dracula (and countless successor vampire novels), though he got his sobriquet “the Impaler” for the brutal methods he employed against his enemies, not for sinking his teeth into virgins. However cruel Vlad was, the monks of Snagov Monastery held him in great esteem and are said to have buried him in their monastery after he was slain in a battle nearby. Take a boat over the peaceful waters to the serene garden and monastery to see the simple marble slab that marks the tomb, as well as the beautiful medieval frescoes that adorn the interior of the monastery. Bucharest is a fascinating combination of Communist grandiosity, elegant French-influenced 19th-century buildings and surprising survivors dating from the 1500s. Perhaps nothing more perfectly encapsulates Romania’s 20th-century experience than the mind-boggling People’s Palace, which you can visit today. Another option is a walking tour that shows you this city from a local’s perspective. Begin the day with a panoramic tour of Bucharest, followed by a traditional three-course Romanian lunch at a local restaurant, before transferring via motorcoach to Giurgiu, where your ship awaits. A panoramic tour will show you that Bucharest is a fascinating combination of Communist grandiosity, elegant French-influenced 19th-century buildings and surprising survivors from the 1500s, which are acquiring new gloss in Lipscani, the restored old quarter. Bucharest began as a fortress in the 15th century, a warlike origin that set the tone for its turbulent history. It saw glory days as the summer residence of the Wallachian princes and was burned to the ground by the Ottoman Turks; then Austria-Hungary and imperial Russia fought over it for a century. After Wallachia and Moldavia united to form Romania in the mid-19th century, Bucharest enjoyed a prosperity that was reflected in its extravagant architecture, some of which miraculously survived WWII bombing and Communist building programs. You’ll see Bucharest’s very own Triumphal Arch, which is modeled after the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and Victoria Boulevard, lined with chic shops and handsomely restored prewar buildings—and sites where protests brought down Ceausescu’s regime in 1989. These days Bucharest enjoys a lively and eclectic cultural scene, hosting international arts festivals and concerts, and a measure of prosperity apparent in its busy cafés and thriving street life. Perhaps no sight in Bucharest more perfectly encapsulates Romania’s 20th-century experience than the mind-boggling structure known as the People’s Palace. Nicolae Ceausescu razed one-sixth of the city to erect this enormous palace—the second-largest building in the world—which all but bankrupted the country and helped trigger his downfall. Some 20,000 laborers worked on the building, which has 1,100 rooms in its 12 stories. Only a small portion of it is open to tours—in fact, only a small portion of the rooms are furnished—but you’ll see the vast marble-sheathed halls, huge chandeliers and basement bomb shelter that comprise an astonishing monument to the dictator’s ambition. The cost to the country was enormous, but the craftsmanship is exquisite; the dictator meant it to be a showcase of Bulgarian decorative arts, and in that he fully succeeded. “Give a penny for the Athenaeum.” Back in the 1880s, this was the theme for the fundraising campaign that resulted in one of Bucharest’s most beautiful and most beloved buildings: the Romanian Athenaeum. Ordinary citizens, not wealthy patrons of the arts, contributed their pennies and built a jewel-box concert hall with perfect acoustics, which they cherish to this day: It’s called the spiritual and artistic heart of the nation. Start to explore the Bucharest locals love right here with a look at the stately neoclassical home of the George Enescu Romanian Philharmonic Orchestra, and continue to Revolution Square, perhaps best known for the moment when Nicolae Ceausescu climbed into a helicopter on the roof of the Central Committee building and fled Bucharest in 1989. Stroll past the elegant shops in the neighborhood, as you head to Lipscani, the restored old quarter. Just a few years ago this neighborhood was all but a shambles; now it is a lively social center. Here you’ll find everything from a famous beer hall to a spectacularly renovated bookstore, as well as the city’s oldest surviving church and the remnants of the Old Princely Court, where the Wallachian rulers—including Vlad the Impaler—lived in the 15th and 16th centuries. Your walking tour ends at Hanul Lui Manuc, built two centuries ago as an inn and recently restored, where you will take a seat in the tree-shaded courtyard and relax over some favorite local appetizers—perhaps some stuffed mushrooms and a variety of sausages. Your next destination, the Basarbovo Rock Monastery, is the only rock monastery where monks still live and worship today. Climb the narrow rock stairway to the 15th-century cloister, which is cut into the limestone cliffs high above the Lom River, and take a look at the arresting frescoes. You’ll also spend some time in Rousse, a city with an easygoing, gracious feeling. Freedom Square, a huge open plaza, takes its name from the Freedom Monument, which soars from the center of the square; the stately Belle Epoque buildings surrounding the square attest to the city’s prosperity in the 1890s. Stroll along wide, tree-lined Alexandrovska, the main pedestrian street that links the city’s many attractive squares, encountering such landmark sights as Rousse’s grand theater, the city museum and the first movie theater (it opened in 1896). Twice the capital of Bulgaria—before and after the Ottomans conquered the nation—Veliko Tarnovo climbs steep hills above the Yantra River, topped by the ruins of Tsarevets, the stronghold where Bulgaria’s kings ruled between 1185 and 1393. The remains of the great stone walls and towers that you see formed the historic heart of the Second Bulgarian Empire. History lives in this town, as a quick look at the wares for sale in Samovod Marketplace will show you: Handicrafts are all made by local artisans using ancient, medieval or Renaissance technologies. You’ll have time to peruse the exceptional local pottery and textiles there before heading to Arbanassi, home to six amazing 17th-century stone churches, each one decorated with colorful and intricate frescoes. Learn something of the multicultural history of this fascinating town at the Ethnographic Museum and visit the UNESCO-designated Nativity Church, where murals of the Nativity, the Last Judgment and the zodiac brilliantly blend religious and humanist iconography. At another of the churches, Holy Archangels Michael and Gabriel, you’ll hear the otherworldly singing of an Orthodox choir in a short concert. Your day’s adventure includes a traditional three-course Bulgarian lunch, complete with live folk music. Drive through the scenic Bulgarian countryside to Belogradchik, a small town in the foothills of the Balkan Mountains, not far from the Serbian border. After some light refreshment at a local hotel, you’ll be ready to explore the astonishing rock formations nearby, which are over 200 million years old—and have inspired nearly as many legends! Many of the strange wind- and weather-hewn shapes have names, such as Adam and Eve, the Bear and the Castle. The outcroppings formed a natural defense for the town that was enhanced with man-made fortifications over the centuries. Whether you choose to hike with a local expert
Congress on Friday expelled Barkha Shukla Singh from the party, a day after she attacked Rahul Gandhi and senior leader Ajay Maken. In one of the swiftest actions witnessed in the Congress, Singh was sacked on Thursday evening within hours of her declaring Rahul “unfit” to lead the party. Singh, who was the president of the Delhi unit of the Mahila Congress, had released pictures of Rahul having dinner at a restaurant with some friends last month. The Disciplinary Action Committee of the Delhi unit of the Congress met Friday morning to unanimously decided to expel Singh from the party for indulging in “anti-party activities” ahead of the elections to the municipal corporations in the capital. Singh, who had complained against “neglect” of women workers in ticket distribution for the Sunday's civic polls, alleged that the party workers were “snubbed” and their grievances were not addressed. On Thursday, Singh had insisted that she was not quitting the party but only her post -- President of the Delhi unit of Mahila Congress.

Tintri, Inc. is an American information technology company based in Mountain View, California, United States, that provides storage for virtualization. I have a Tintri all-flash SAN and it works great. It was simple to setup, has relatively few settings to worry about, and provides fast access to all of my VMs. Fast, simple, and great features. Tintri has been an amazing company to work with. We became a customer in December 2015 and were very pleased with the sales process. Dominick, our sales rep was very clear and open about the expectations and they were willing to work with us and be creative on pricing. The delivery of the unit took about a week and installation took about an hour. After our networking and hosts were configured, the software setup and inclusion into our vSphere environment took about 2 hours. Now we have over 50vms running at blazing speed and very efficiently at under 500 IOPs on average. The interface lets me easily see whats going on in the entire environment and can diagnose system wide issues or individual VM issues very quickly. The Tintri cloning feature allows me to maximize used space by cloning templates and only writing change blocks for that new VM. The VM-centric view that Tintri takes was perfect for us both in manageability and visibility. Thanks kevinmhsieh for suggesting Tintri. Thanks Jonahzona for suggesting Tintri. With the information and requirements that you have provided, Tintri would be a great fit. Should a primarily HP Company move forward with EMC now that Dell has acquired? Thanks for bringing up Tintri. Upgraded our Nexenta SAN with a T850 Tintri NAS. Design and Install District wide security camera system.
The HHP-2 accurately aligns and presses 1", 1-1/8", 1-1/4", and 1.5" headset cups. In addition, it presses cartridge bearings and cups into one-piece bottom bracket shells and holds fixed cup wrenches firmly in place when removing or installing adjustable-type bottom brackets. Features a quick-release design for fast tool installation and removal, extra long (30cm) handles for superior leverage, and stepped bushings for precise cup alignment. Great tool - do your replacementsupgrades on your schedule! My local shop doesn't charge much to press headsetBBs in, but this lets me do it on my time. And I used to workmanage bike shops, so I know what I'm doing. Well built, easy to use quality tool. A must have for guys who like to build their own bikes. A quality and easy to use tool that will last a lifetime. However, a bit pricey for a tool that isn't used a lot. Five stars for performance and build quality generally, three stars for value. Averages out to four stars. If you are a pro mechanic pressing lots of bearings, then this seems like what you need.

Did you know that October is National Orthodontic Health Month? Here at Amazing Smiles Orthodontics, this means taking a little extra time to educate people about what orthodontics is, how beneficial orthodontic treatment can be, and how to achieve a healthy, aligned smile. It also happens to be the month we celebrate copious amounts of free candy…we mean, Halloween! If you have a child in braces, it’s natural to feel a little anxious about helping them navigate through bowls and bags full of candy. Nothing can knock the fun out of trick-or-treating or fall festivals like a broken bracket or bent wire, so it’s important to pay attention to the kind of sweets they indulge in. We want your family to be able to focus on all the good things Halloween has to offer without waiting around for an emergency orthodontic appointment, so we’ve put together our Top 4 Tips For Surviving Halloween With Braces to help you make the most of the holiday! Remind your child that he or she shouldn’t eat anything out of their bag until you have a chance to go through it. As you inspect their haul, pull out any hard candy, as well as anything that has nuts or caramel, since these can stick to the wires or in the brackets. Chewy treats like gum and Tootsie Rolls also need to go. Does your child have plans to attend any Halloween parties? If so, make sure they remember to avoid restricted foods outside the home, too. For example, candy apples and caramel corn are party favorites, but they can wreak havoc on braces. You can’t control what others are giving out on Halloween night, or what snacks will be served at parties, but you can keep a small amount of braces-friendly candy on hand in your own home. This gives your child a few treats they can enjoy anytime without worry. Plain chocolates and soft cookies are good choices. Even if you plan to do the traditional trick-or-treating, or have parties to attend, consider making your own braces-friendly treats to make up for any candy that can’t be eaten. We’ll list a couple of ghoulishly good recipes we love below. Bonus: these are not only delicious, but healthy, too! In a clear glass, layer pineapple, oranges, and Cool Whip. Garnish with a few pieces of candy corn. Serve immediately, or chill until ready to serve. Line a 9-inch baking pan with parchment or waxed paper. Peel the bananas and cut them in half crosswise at a slight angle. Insert a popsicle stick into the cut end of each banana and push it about halfway up. Push the pointy top of 2 chocolate chips into each banana to make the eyes of the ghosts. Put into the freezer to firm up, at least 3 hours. Remove pops from the freezer and use a knife to trim away any yogurt that pooled and froze along the sides of the banana. Serve straight from the freezer. Note: Once pops are frozen, store them in a resealable bag or covered container in the freezer. Operation Gratitude sends care packages to U.S. troops stationed in overseas and first responders here at home. Their mission is putting smile on soldiers’ faces, and kids are encouraged to include letters and pictures with their donation. Similar to Operation Gratitude but on a smaller scale, Soldiers’ Angels do a “Treats for Troops” event annually. Click here to find a donation drop-off point. You can even register to start a drive of your own! The Ronald McDonald House is well-known for providing a place for families to stay together when a child is seriously ill, and most locations will accept donations of unopened candy for their resident families after Halloween. You can find your local chapter here, but you may want to call ahead to find out the rules for dropping off candy. If you want to keep things closer to home, check with your local soup kitchen, homeless shelter, food pantry, or nursing home. Many are happy to take donations of unopened candy for residents and guests! Chances are good you already monitor your child’s brushing and flossing habits, but this is especially important in the week or two after Halloween. Even if you keep them away from restricted treats, there’s still plenty of sugar in the leftover sweet stuff to lead to extra plaque and even cavities. Children should be brushing at least twice a day, and preferably after any sugary snack. And don’t forget nightly flossing! When it comes to getting through Halloween with braces on, try to keep the emphasis on all the fun treats that are still available to your child, instead of focusing on what they can’t have. Remember that if you have any questions or concerns, including braces-related worries about the holidays, our team is always just a call away. Whatever your family’s plans for Halloween this month, we wish you a spooktacularly safe and happy holiday!
My wife and I were pleasantly surprised by our car-buying experience. From the test drive with Kyle, who definitely knew the product to Nicole in the finance office, who made a complicated procedure easy and painless! We felt the price we paid was fair without having to haggle. My husband and I were looking for a vehicle that was great on gas and great in the snow,as i will be doing quite a bit of traveling the next few months. Ryan showed us a 2014 Crosstrek! I love it! The process was very quick. The car needed front wheel bearings and Ryan set it up to have them installed at no charge to me. I was able to drop my vehicle off and get a loaner over night. Our overall experience was amazing. I highly recommend New Motors for you next vehicle purchase. Ryan was very polite and has even called again to check to make sure i am still satisfied after the bearings were put in. The service department was also very polite and helpful for getting my appointment set up. Excellent staff with very nice clean inventory. I would highly recommend LeBoeuf Auto Sales to all you shoppers looking for quality used cars. I would definitely recommend buying a car from here. Tom Kuna was my salesman and was an amazing help through the process and got me in the car I wanted! I have been dealing with Bianchi Honda for over 40 years. I have just purchased my 6th Honda and it was like all of the other times. Effortless and no drama. I have bought my second Odessey from Daniel Milhisler and it is always a pleasure to do business with hihm. Always professional and he knows his product. Dan is always available to answer any questions I might have about how to use some of the gadgets on the vehicle. He is available for this anytime in the life cycle of the van. Over the many years of dealing with Bianchi I have dealt with most of the different departments. From Sales to Service you can tell that Jason has instilled his customer care attitude throughout his organization. I have had many dealings with the service department over the years and Phil Pinyok has done a great job taking care of Bianchi customers service needs. I have never left Bianchi's not feeling satisfied that my needs were met. The quality of the Honda vehicles matched with the honest customer appreciation shown by the entire staff make it the reason that I don't go elsewhere for my transportation needs. To Jason and the entire Bianchi staff: "Keep up the good work and thank you". We recently leased a new Alfa Romeo Stelvio Ti Sport with Justin Sutton at Auto Express and could not be happier with the experience. We were out of state buyers and Justin worked with us to make the whole process as streamlined and stress-free as possible. When we flew into town, he had arranged for us to be picked up at the dealership and we were on the road in our new Alfa in under an hour. Justin was very upfront with the pricing, which was extremely competitive, and there were no surprises when it came time to sign the deal. I highly recommended working with Justin and Auto Express. We don’t regret bypassing the 3 dealerships within two hours of us to work with them at all and will hopefully did it again in the future. I had driven my 2011 Subaru Outback for 7 years & was ready for a new one. Ryan was very helpful & knowledgeable about the 2019 model. We drove both the Outback & the Forrester & in the end decided on the Outback due to incentives offered by Subaru & dealership. I???ve used New Motors for service & have always been happy with them. I???m ready for this winter knowing my Subaru will go thru any snowstorm! Had an amazing experience at new motors. Very friendly staff, only took about 2 hours and boom! We were done and had bought a car! It was by far the quickest amount of time I???ve ever spent in a dealership buying a car. They know their business and do it well. Chris was very helpful and answered all of our questions and got this whole car buying process done quickly and efficiently. Allan who took care of all the paperwork was knowledgeable and super easy and friendly to deal with! We will be doing all our business with this dealership from here on out!! Thanks to all of you! Keep up the good work!! I provided New Motors an "Excellent" rating. From the time I initially inquired about a vehicle with Taneeka to the day I picked it up I had nothing but friendly smiles and great conversations. I personally worked with Seth Murphy, he was very knowledgeable about the Subaru Crosstrek which was helpful and he was open to any question I had. He was able to provide me solid answers which inevitably lead me to purchasing my first "new" car. While filling out the paperwork with Allen Yingling he was able to provide me with even more information in which I was unaware of. All in all, Seth & Allen were straight-up with me, there wasn't any pressure to add anything in which I was comfortable with. I had a very pleasant time working with New Motors and would recommend them to anyone looking for a new vehicle. This was my first time ever purchasing a car, and I was quite nervous about it. I originally was interested in a used Outback, but after speaking with Taneeka Shetler over the phone regarding various pricing deals I decided to purchase new. After doing extensive research online I went into the dealership to test drive the 2019 Forester and Crosstrek. Mike Francis was quick to assist me, and listened to what I was looking for in a car. I had walked into the dealership fairly set on the Crosstrek, but after hearing my priorities and concerns Mike helped me decide on the smaller and more affordable Crosstrek. It was an absolutely no-pressure environment, and I felt that Mike thoroughly and completely answered any questions I had to ask. After I had made my decision and returned for the final purchase, both Mike and Allen Yingling made sure that I knew exactly what each signature and piece of paper was for, as well as my options for financing and payment. Allen thoroughly explained my protection and warranty options, and was happy to answer all of my questions (though he was so thorough, I didn't have many questions at all!) As a first-time car buyer I was very nervous, but I was put at ease the moment I began working with Mike and the New Motors team. I would certainly recommend them to family and friends, or for anyone looking for an informative, no-pressure dealership. Thank you! Worked with Steve Quinn at New Motors to purchase a used BMW 535i xDrive. I saw the car on their website, and stopped in to talk to someone about the car. Of course I felt uncomfortable as I waited for someone to talk to, I've bought many many cars over the years, and it's always felt like a me vs them situation. Steve finished delivering a car to another customer, and we sat down at his desk to talk. We learned quickly that Steve is very knowledgeable about BMWs, and was very interested to get us up to speed on the car we were interested in and it's features. We went for a test drive, and Steve helped us understand the car features . After a bit of discussion, we settled on a price, and decided to buy the car. Steve said he could have the car detailed and everything ready for the next morning. We came back the next morning, talked to Steve for a bit then met with Allen Yingling to discuss the financing and maintenance options. I was very impressed that Allen searched many options for the financing, and found an option much better then my local credit union which is usually best. Allen also gave us several options for the maintenance of the car, and even though we chose not to purchase any of the maintenance packages, Allen was understanding and didn't push. We really liked that. A few minutes later we left with the car. Overall, it was a great experience. From Steve's knowledge and obvious passion about BMWs to Allen's financing work and no pressure approach, we really enjoyed the experience. Way different than what I 'm used to at other dealerships. This is my second Subaru purchase from New motors. Both times the experience was wonderful/ Everyone I dealt with was courteous and willing to help in any way possible. Cory was informative, but offered no pressure, which is what I wanted.
The tab titles “Description” and “Reviews” are crammed into the left corner. I want them to move more to the right. 00:02: I toggle Chrome development tools (dev tools) by right-click, inspect. I right-click on the element I want to change. Clicking on the element I want to edit opens the markup and jumps to the vicinity or right on the element I want to edit. 00:09: After the dev tools open I realise the layout is now responsive. I need it to be in standard desktop layout. I switch the dev tools from dock right to dock to bottom. This gives the layout more room in width and gets rid of the responsive layout. 00:17: I click on the elements in the markup until my element is fully selected. At first #tab-reviews looks good, but ultimately reviews_tab is more complete in highlighting my element. You often have to correct the element selection after toggling the dev tools via right-click – inspect. 00:22: The WooCommerce tabs class has a margin defined. Seems right. I deactivate what is already there to see if anything changes. I then add some on my own and watch for changes. It gets crossed out immediately which means it is getting overwritten. No good, moving on. 00:34: I move up one class and spot the padding. Editing to see if that changes anything and heureka. The rest is simple try and error. That is it. I hope it helps you to find your own CSS classes to successfully apply your custom CSS. Feel free to comment with any questions you have.

For foreign trade business man or in merchant credit card payment processor industry, you have to know well the exchange rate. When you are duty, the first thing in the morning is to check the exchange rate of different countries. It is generally as central bank or Bank of China rate as reference. Because foreign trade are processing large quantity of business, a little fluctuation will have a great effect. And this procedure only requires 10 minutes. The second base work is to maintain your client. It is compulsory lesson for every sales man and it should be started from every single detail. Check your email everyday and client following up schedule to find which clients have not been contacted recently. Send them a greeting email one by one every 2-3 weeks in general. And the email content should be varied according to each client. Keep in touch with client who have not cooperated, let him remember you. If one day the client is just about to change the supplier and see your email in the mean time, he might take a look at you then it’s your chance. Keep in mind that the email content is brief and slight. Never send a long-winded email. They don’t have that much time to read a bunch of introduction. It will make your client feel antipathy. Keep in touch with your client who had already deal with you. It will improve relationship between. Every after sales service is a opportunity of reorder. And it will strengthen the impression of the client at you and it will do good effect. Same as above, the email to follow up on this should be brief and slight. Remind your old client about considering new order. If you old client receive your email, they may reply you in short time. Some of them may even tell you when they will place new order. This is no doubt the best situation. These things are simple and will no take over too much time but will give good effect.
Life insurance companies are making a fortune by having websites whereby clients can request for free quotes. Even though the clients are purchasing life insurance policy, it gives the insurance agents leads that they can contact later for a follow-up. When you submit your request, the agents send you an email containing your requested quote. The insurance agents will make sure they contact you a few days after you receive your quote. Making it in the life insurance business requires a lot of hard work and commitment. The insurance agents have to keep looking for quality leads that will bring forth new clients. It is their way of making a commission for each new client they convince and gets to purchase a policy. They can't get clients by sitting down and wait for them to come running to them or go door to door selling the policies. They simply peruse the leads with all available means and hope their effort pays up. When clients request quotes from different companies, they are only looking for the company that offers the lowest rate. When the agents call regarding the sent quote trying to pursue you, you can tell them you can't buy from them since you have a lower quote. In many cases, the agents will come back to you with a lower quote than offered before. Another essential way that the agents secure leads is from their customers. Referrals from their clients are likely to bring a huge return to your company as people tend to trust your service if they are referred by someone who has dealt with you in the past. The cycle continues where a friend tells friends and you can never run out of business. If you are on the run to succeed in the life insurance sector, then getting life insurance leads is the way to go.

New York City police have arrested three men who they said barged into a St. John’s University dorm in Queens Wednesday with the intent to rob students and fired off a gunshot during the intrusion. Anthony Gusthas, 18, Mustafa Godbolt, 21 and Tyrell Sutton, 17, all of Queens, were being arraigned Thursday in Queens Criminal Court on charges of first-degree burglary, first-degree attempted robbery, second- and fourth-degree criminal possession of a weapon and fifth-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance, said Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown, in a news release. Their attorneys could not be reached for comment and arraignment information was not available. NYPD officials said three suspects entered Hollis Hall on Utopia Parkway just before 2 p.m. and engaged in an argument with several students before one of the suspects fired a shot. No one was injured, but at least one of the suspects rummaged through the students’ belongings before they fled, authorities said. Brown said a police officer saw the defendants walking on 167th Street and the Grand Central Parkway shortly after the robbery and that Sutton dropped a backpack and Godbolt dropped a jar when he approached them. Police found “duct tape, rope, scissors and a loaded .38 caliber Smith and Wesson black revolver with three live rounds of ammunition and a shell casing in the chamber from the backpack; 150 Alprazolam (Xanax) pills from the jar; and a .38 caliber round of ammunition from the dorm room,” Brown said.
Hi folks, I'm wanting to make my first bohemian pilsner in a couple of weeks, but having read up on the style it seems my water is rather inappropriate . Is there a good supermarket 5 litre bottled water that would be good to use, as is or with some additions? Is it not possible to adjust your water to make it more appropriate, that obviously depends what your starting water is, alternatively blending your current water with Ashbeck could work. Using a more modest calcium level is a bonus for lager yeast. Lower is actually better. AJ Delange prefers bringing the Ca level to about 20 ppm and the chloride level to about 30 ppm. He is a malt-head and apparently despises sulfate. However, Dr. Narziss has indicated to John Palmer in personal communications that many of the breweries in Pilsen do add gypsum to their brewing liquor. I happen to know that this admission makes AJ boil since he swears that noble hops are destroyed by any sulfate content. I think AJ is full of sh*t and I relish that evidence that sulfate is OK, even in a fairly malty style like Boh Pils. In fact, Boh Pils is a very hoppy and bitter style with a substantial malt backbone. So the sulfate helps with drying the finish and accentuating the bitterness. The assumption of using only chloride in a Boh Pils is not ideal. I'd say a more even application of chloride and sulfate is a more sound approach. In any case, I would still keep the calcium content fairly low. There is another factor that a brewer should consider. Having over 40 ppm calcium in the mash is a very good way to drop most of the malt's oxalate content in the tun and that reduces beerstone production in the rest of the brewery. Fortunately, it is possible to boost mash Ca content and still keep the overall Ca content lower in the kettle. Add all the calcium salts to the mashing water and keep the sparging water Ca content at near zero. That gives us the best of both worlds. With the mash at 40 ppm and the sparge at zero, the kettle should be around 20 ppm. Just about right. The calcium content of a 1040 distilled water mash gives wort with 40 calcium from the malt alone so getting down to 20 in the kettle?? Wally, thanks for pointing out that malt contributes calcium to the wort. It contributes many other ionic and organic compounds to the wort too. However, I was referring to only the additional calcium contributed by the water. mabrungard wrote: The assumption of using only chloride in a Boh Pils is not ideal. I'd say a more even application of chloride and sulfate is a more sound approach. In any case, I would still keep the calcium content fairly low. Of course it does depend on what you have in the water to start with. A lot of UK waters have significantly more sulphate than chloride to start with, so only using calcium chloride to boost calcium makes sense as it is bringing the sulphate chloride ratio into balance . . . or even slightly chloride biased . . . which for a beer with a high hop rate but well developed malt backbone makes sense. I couldn't get to have a chat with the brewers in Plzen when I was there (88), but in some of the outlying towns I was able to talk to some brewers and even assist in brewing a couple of batches. In those breweries they use calcium chloride to add additional calcium, again I am not aware what else was present in the water, but it worked for them.

ournal of Clinical Medical Genomics J o u r n a l o f C l i n i c a l & M e d i c a l G e n o m i c s ISSN: 2472-128X Abstract The divorce rate rose steadily in recent years, becoming a significant social problem. Many studies showed that the divorce has negative impact on children, but there are many different interpretations of the consequences of this situation on children�s lives. There... Divorce is the legal dissolution of a marriage. Divorce is a complicated and painful experience that includes an emotional, financial, and social dissolution of a couple. impact this experience has on children is a key issue for policymakers since although the government wants to support stable relationships between parents, where they break down there is a responsibility to provide support to optimise positive outcomes for children. �Whatever the cause, divorce will remain a part of society � all we can do is learn to cope with the effects of it, and try not to let it ruin our outlook on relationships and marriage� (Collins, 2003:32).
If you’re even remotely anxious about flying, don’t watch this video without a change of pants close at hand. While practicing a series of stunts, the engine on pilot Chad Barber’s biplane died during a steep climb, causing it to immediately stall and make a direct, terrifying detour back to Earth. After leveling out, the plane essentially become a glider without a massive set of wings to keep it safely aloft. Barber tried again and again to bring its engine back to life. He finally succeeded moments before he would have had to make an emergency landing on a road that looked very un-friendly to planes traveling at high speeds. As he pulls the plane out of its descent just in the nick of time, you can finally hear Barber react to the incident with a mixture of relief and shock in his voice. Is anyone else only planning to take Greyhound bus trips across the country from here on out?

AdLatch is a handly system for bloggers and website owners which helps them confront adblockers in an unconventional way. The tool delivers a variety of benefits for adblocker users, such as covering payment issues for publishers in order to let them invest their time in providing better content. Even if it performs a demanding function, AdLatch is designed in a user-friendly manner, and offers many simple practices that make brands more visible. Its most popular feature is the two-liner code, which ensures a variety of social sharing, donation, and paywall options. Alongside its powerful features, there is another solid reason to consider it – AdLatch has one-of-a-kind pricing scheme, with an unpaid basic package for as much as 1 million visits, and three separate professional plans which are also moderately priced. Besides, AdLatch is supported on all internet browsers, and can be tracked also on mobile devices. All users are entitled to fast and reliable email support. Generally, AdLatch helps you assist users to overcome the problem of blocked content, and build a profitable relationship out of it. The secret of making AdLatch work on your website is the powerful two-liner code, which you simply paste on the website’s head section, and automatically start benefiting from the three main functions and gain revenue. But how does it happen? Firstly, AdLatch ensures that you will obtain an email subscription from all visitors landing on your website, as long as they’re using adblocker. Secondly, you will have the opportunity to ask the very same visitors (now users) to share your website on their social media profiles or personal websites. Thirdly, and most importantly, you can ask those visitors to use your paywall and make a donation, being the most effective revenue generation practice. Best of all, you will be able to offer a variety of payment options to simplify the donation process, and to motivate users to participate. As we already mentioned, AdLatch is a powerful tool also when it comes to brand visibility. While it can’t stop your current adblocker extension, it can provide you reputable alternatives, and still help you extend the reach of your brand regardless of the type of adblocker users you’re working with. Visitors will love it as they see a well-organized email subscription box, and will (as practice shows) be delighted to share the website on their own profiles. To make things even easier for them, you can set up a simplified donation procedure, activated with a single button in a lapse of approximately 30 seconds. Finally, AdLatch is a responsible and self-sufficient system even in terms of analytics, as it quantifies users’ behavior, and delivers exquisite stats on their activities. The numerous insights will help you monitor what they’re sharing, or how often they’re sharing it, and will give you a clear answer to the question of whether you’re gaining revenue from them or not. Email Subscribing: You have visitors using adblocker and you are concerned about the money you are losing because of it. What would you do? AdLatch solves this issue by giving away the chance of converting the visitors into your mail subscribers. As soon as the user using adblocker visits your site, a pop up appear asking them to subscribe to our email. So you can keep promoting your content to them, in spite of existence of adblocker. Social Sharing: You can also provide your visitors an option to share your content on their social media accounts. In this way, neither your visitors will have to see the ads nor does your website need to block those visitors. Paywall or Donation: Another amazing option you can render to your website visitor is by asking them a small payment of $5 as gratitude. You can always ask them to contribute to pay directly, so that you may recover your loss. There are popular and widely used systems in each software group. But are they essentially the best fit for your organization’s unique wants? A trendy software product may have thousands of customers, but does it present what you need?

Check out the free trials of these products, read online opinions, get clarifications from the vendor, and do your investigation thoroughly. This in-depth groundwork is sure to assist you choose the best software platform for your firm’s unique needs. How Much Does AdLatch Cost? We realize that when you make a decision to buy Marketing Software it’s important not only to see how experts evaluate it in their reviews, but also to find out if the real people and companies that buy it are actually satisfied with the product. That’s why we’ve created our behavior-based Customer Satisfaction Algorithm™ that gathers customer reviews, comments and AdLatch reviews across a wide range of social media sites. The data is then presented in an easy to digest form showing how many people had positive and negative experience with AdLatch. With that information at hand you should be equipped to make an informed buying decision that you won’t regret. What are AdLatch pricing details? What integrations are available for AdLatch? Currently, there are no integrations available, but users are invited to use the AdLatch code on their blogs/websites to engage with adblocker-using visitors in a variety of ways. I have been using Adlatch for almost 3 weeks now on my 8 blogs and I am so far, I am very happy so far. I have recieved some donations, over 100 new email subscribers and clear idea about the loss I have been making due to these adblockers. Before Adlatch, I tried Pagefair but Adlatch provides a way more advanced platform to address this growing issue of adblocks.
Atmel announced the availability of the new set of highly-integrated system basis gate driver ICs. The Atmel ATA6843 and ATA6844 devices are new members of the company's extensive gate driver family designed for 3-phase brushless DC (BLDC) motor control applications including turbo chargers, waste gates, EGR, pumps, fans, power window, power doors and power seats. They feature six-output stages for direct motor control when combined with an Atmel AVR® microcontroller (MCU), and an on-chip Atmel automotive LIN transceiver IP for in-car communication. The new driver ICs are the only products in the industry to incorporate all the essential functional blocks to supply and monitor a microcontroller in BLDC motor control applications. This feature enables a smaller footprint for applications with limited space and increases the overall system safety. With most automotive BLDC motor applications located in hot under-the-hood environments, the ability to withstand extremely hot temperatures is a device requirement. The new Atmel ATA6844 is a high-temperature version to operate at chip temperatures of up to 200 degrees C. The device is manufactured in Atmel's own state-of-the-art BCD-on-SOI technology SMART-I.S.(TM) for extreme temperatures, and enables direct attachment of the ECU to hot actuators for short wiring and optimized construction. Atmel automotive-qualified AVR microcontrollers are ideally suited to support the new system basis gate driver ICs in various BLDC motors with Hall sensors as well as sensorless BLDC motors with back-electromagnetic force (BEMF) sensing. With the devices' six input stages, the MCU individually controls each of the six output stages. The MCU also defines the adjustable overcurrent detection threshold of the ATA6843/44 to enable a current monitoring tailored to the various types of power MOSFETs used in the application. The new gate driver ICs ATA6843 and ATA6844 contain comprehensive protection and diagnostic functions, such as monitoring of overtemperature, overvoltage, undervoltage, short-circuit conditions and charge-pump failures. All incidents are communicated via three-diagnostic outputs to the microcontroller to enable appropriate countermeasures. A coast function allows simultaneous disabling of all six output stages in case of emergency. The on-board integrated watchdog independently monitors the MCU to increase the overall system safety, eliminating an additional external component. Dangerous short-circuit currents caused by faulty control signals are prevented from the pin-programmable timer stage that allows users to set a dead time for disabling unintended simultaneous activation of a high-side and a low-side power MOSFET within one branch. With Atmel's LIN2.1-compliant transceiver IP integrated on chip, the new system basis gate driver ICs are perfectly suited for in-car communication via the standard automotive network. Samples of the ATA6843 and ATA6844 are available now, both in QFN48 7 x 7mm packages. Pricing starts at USD $2.10 (ATA6843) and $2.40 (ATA6844) for quantities of 10,000. To simplify and speed-up bench tests, pre-programmed ATA6843/44 design kits for sensorless or Hall sensor type BLDC motors are also available.
For about a week, I have not used shampoo or conditioner! I tried the “no poo” method two summers ago, kept it up for a mere 2 weeks, then quit. It was working but I got lazy and switched back. I still don’t have it down to an exact science yet, but it’s going good so far. In my shower I now have two spray bottles (need to invest in better ones). One is filled with a baking soda and water mixture and the other is a combination of apple cider vinegar and water. I don’t think I have the ratio right so I will have to try again the next batch. Here is the link to the website that inspired me. There are healthier and cheaper alternatives out there for everything- We live in such a consumeristic society where the norm is to throw away and buy, throw away and buy. Honestly, I’m not so concerned with “being green” or saving the planet, I just want to break away from this society that holds materialism in high standards. I love being creative and coming up with ways to recycle and refurbish old things. Making your own products (shampoo, deodorant etc..) is easy, saves you a lot of money (including the gas you’d spend to go out to purchase them), and is healthier- no chemicals or toxins. To me it seems like a win win. Update: I’m kicking myself for not sticking with this earlier. I don’t have to wash my hair everyday and it feels so silky!! Before if I missed a day of washing, it would get really oily.. Today was day two without and it was completely fine- will see how tomorrow goes! This entry was posted in Beauty/Skin Care.

"Our lives aren't worth anything" Thousands of Trans*Women live in the big cities of Turkey. There has been an increase in the murder of Trans*. Hate Crimes against Trans*Women are mostly not investigated. The perpetrators can usually rely on being exempted from prosecution. How does hate murder develop? The film accompanies Ebru, a Trans*Woman from Istanbul who fights against the displacement and murder of her companions. She has experienced exclusion from state, society and family in her own life. She wants to change Turkish society with humour, self-irony and political acumen. She meets Margarethe, a 85-year-old German retired nurse and establishes with her an retirement home for Trans*. The film shows how hate speech develops to hate murder in a structure with many different components, how hate crime works as a system. Urban transformation of Istanbul and the protests around the Gezi Park in 2013 resonate throughout the film.

A reality of life is that very few people have become adults and gone through college without having developed some ways naturally to deal with stress. In younger years we may have been very physically active or perhaps had a nice set of friends that we talked with on a regular basis. We may have taken time to escape or our rooms and listen to music we liked. Most often we have developed some behaviors that helped us deal with problems of life that helped us. As we grow we have a tendency to move away from what helped us in the past because our live situations change and our life patterns change. Then when stress builds we may be at a loss on what to do to deal with it. The first step we should take is to look back at what helped us deal with stress in the past. Then ask yourself if it is possible to do these things in the present. If getting high was how you handled stress as a teenager, then it is probably not a good stress release today. However, if you exercised in the past and that helped, perhaps adding that exercise into your daily routine today would be helpful. If you were a cross country runner, you may not want to run as far, but you may find adding a run several times a week helps. (Exercise helps our body create chemicals in our bodies that help with stress.) If you have not exercised in a long long time, you will want to be sure that you do so in a healthy way and not do too much causing physical harm. Perhaps you dealt with stress by talking with friends. (Conversations with friends help create chemicals that help with stress.) Do you have friends with whom you can talk without constantly talking about problems? If not, can you begin developing some? If you are married, you probably have a built in stress reliever that you may have forgotten about. Most people get married because they enjoy spending time with someone. After some years a marriage and children coming along, spending that enjoyable time with the spouse might dwindle to very little or to nothing. Make sure that you and your spouse can spend some fun time together on a regular basis. This should be a convenient easily accessible stress reliever. Look back at what has worked in the past and see what you can do from that list today. The strength in tapping into what worked in the past is that it not only has a proven track record in reducing stress, it is something that you are more likely continue. When we add something completely different to our life, we may not be as likely to continue doing it. For instance if you read that gardening is a good stress reliever, which it can be, you may decide to start gardening just to find out that you really do not enjoy it and then it simply adds to stress, rather than reducing it. And it will be something that you will not continue.

Chelsea and QPR have warned their supporters that "abuse and discrimination has no place in football or society" ahead of their FA Cup clash on Saturday. The game will be the first time Chelsea captain John Terry and QPR defender Anton Ferdinand have faced each other since the Blues' 1-0 defeat in October. Terry has been charged with racially abusing Ferdinand during the game and will appear in court on February 1. He has denied the charge. However the two clubs have now moved to show a united front. Bruce Buck, chairman of Chelsea, and Tony Fernandes, his QPR counterpart, said in the statement: "We have discussed the issues surrounding this weekend's FA Cup fourth-round tie at Loftus Road and we are both in total agreement that abuse and discrimination has no place in football or society." The statement continued: "Both clubs enjoy fantastic support. However, we would remind fans that while we want to hear their passion, it's a fact that hatred and abuse is not what being a fan of Chelsea or QPR is about. "The clubs will work together with the police to ensure that anyone using discriminatory or inflammatory language is identified and that the strongest possible action is taken against them. "A local derby is always a special occasion and this weekend's FA Cup tie is a unique opportunity to show the world that hatred has no place in our game, our clubs, or our communities. "We would urge fans witnessing any form of abuse to report it to a matchday steward or text confidentially on 07557 435421. "Let's make Saturday's match a celebration of football." The match has been brought forward to a midday kick-off on the advice of police in a bid to minimise potential crowd problems, with both clubs keen to avoid any ill-feeling amongst fans.
Although we may think of hospitals as pillars of society that exist to provide treatment when we need it, the quality of care that we can receive is not always consistent. Human factors can ultimately influence the quality of care that we receive. Despite being considered a well managed condition, high blood pressure still contributes to 1 in 7 deaths. As a result, it is important to consider more than just medications when it comes to trying to fight hypertension in order to reduce our health risks. As a devastating disease, ALS or MND has refused to yield its secrets for a great many years with the result being no real effective ALS treatment in sight. However, in recent years, knowledge about the disease from, ALS research, has increased dramatically. Though insulin resistance and obesity are closely related, obesity is not the only factor that can cause individuals to develop the condition. Both internal and external factors can contribute to the development of the condition.

I hope you are all doing well. Today's blog is going to be another monthly favourites so this blog will probably be kind of long, so let's get into it.. Also I want to quickly state that with it being Christmas and New Year time I've been busy so busy that I haven't had time to take pictures of this months favourites blog post but if you go onto my instagram I'm sure there will be pictures of all the products mentioned on there. I've mentioned this before in my "Liverpool Blog Event" blog post and on my instagram but I am going to mention it again because it really is so amazing. I received this in the event goodie bag for free and have been using it literally every day since, and it's really been worth it. I've had bad acne in my teenage years as I've mentioned a couple of times in the past and towards the end of 2015 it was starting to get worse and worse. I'm so glad I was given this in my goodie bag because it really has changed my life, my skin is feeling so clean and calm and beautiful. I would highly recommend this to everyone who has dry skin or acne because it's really helped me so much. I am in love with Ciate's nail polish is shade 'Tweed'. I got it in my Decemeber Glossybox and I've been wearing it above the Barry M Gelly Nail Polish I mentioned above. It makes me nails feel and look, not just Christmas-like but also a little bit rocker-vibed. I adore it! I bought this only in shade 'Make A Statement' (number five), which is a beautiful red colour, at first because as it's matte I didn't want to waste my money and end up hating it. Since then I've bought another one, in shade "Model Behabiour" which is a pretty pink colour (number four), and I have to admit these are the best I've tried all year. I've said over and over again how much I love my Ted Baker Lip Crayon's in the past but these are so much better! Just like the say they have a smooth and creamy texture but they also last a really long time when wearing. Barry M have brought out five shades in this amazing product and they are all creamy, valvet-matte texture glides of smoothness. Another awesome product I received in a Glossybox. I love what it says on the back of this product: "The Enhancing Serum Base is your dose of extreme youth in just 20s! Through its compound made with ultra moisturising and antioldont active ingredients, your skin becomes supple and comfortable again to be always beautiful whatever you environment!" After using this product for a while now I couldn't agree more! This is another product that has really been helping my acne so much, it drys quick and easy and doesn't leave my skin sticky or red. I've been using this morning and evening in December just before putting on my moisturiser. I love it. I never ever thought I would find better than the Garnier Skin Naturals Micellar Cleansing Water (click the name to read my review on the product) but I really have with Bioderma Sensibio H2O Solution Micellaire! I've been putting a few drops of this onto a cotton wool pad and wiping off all my makeup and the dirt that my face has collected in the day time whilst wearing my makeup. It's helped me out so much and I love this product! You really do only need a few drops on a cotton wool pad to get rid of all your makeup and dirt at the end of every day. Sensibio H2O is the 1st and only dermatological micellar water perfectly compatible with the skin: its fatty acid esters, the constituent elements of micelles, are similar to the phospholipids of the skin cell membranes and naturally help rebuild the skin's hydrolipidic film. Lip scrubs are one of my favourite beauty products to use, and Lush Cosmetics ones are my favourite of all time. Lip scrubs are also one of my essentials for a pamper night too. Lush Cosmetics' Santa lip scrub has to be my favourite I've ever tried. Just like our face, our lips need some loving too - lip scrubs are great for this! Santa lip scrub from Lush Cosmetics is obviously exfolating but is also moisturising and leaves my lips feeling like brand new lips. As you can tell by it's name, the Santa lip scrub is a Christmas special edition for Lush Cosmetics which tastes and smells of cola and cherries. I love it! *Spoiler Alert* Oh My Gosh. Fatboy. Arthur. Has passed away... well to be fair he was murdered by Ronnie Mitchelle.. or was it Vincents mum really? She basically knew and done nothing about it. Fatboy hated small, dark spaces as they made him scared as his mum used to lock him in them and how horrible to die locked in a dark, small cars boot. I'm gutted Arthur has had to leave Eastenders but I do wish him all the luck as an actor in the future. On a happier note - JACK IS BACK?! I literally let out a squeal when he walked into the club. Jack is amazing and is rumoured to be staying for a long while. The story behind me buying this Starbucks Coffee is that, we ran out of coffee at home and Phil and me were in our local Tesco supermarket doing our food shopping when we seen this one was less than half price (we got it for £1 instead of £3.50). As I love Starbucks and I love coffee, and I had never tried this before it seemed a little perfect match. You all know how much of a massive coffee lover I am anyway but I have been addicted to this coffee all month now, and our coffee machine is one of my item things in our home. When I do run out of our packet of this coffee I am going to be going out and buying another packet, even if it does mean at full price (which to be honest isn't that pricey really), so I would recommend that you try this stuff if you haven't already and you are a coffee lover. I hope you all enjoyed my monthly favourites this month, if you have tried or own any of these products let me know what is your opinion on them? If you would like a full review on a certain product or you want to just give me your thoughts then please do so either by commenting below or by tweeting me. I hope you all have a wonderful day, have a incredible 2015 and have an amazing 2016! I love the Santa Lip Scrub from Lush too!

What a gorgeous summer we are currently having in this little part of the world. And what better way to celebrate summer than to wear floral clothes? Florals are big this season. "Err, aren't they big every year?" I hear you say. "Err, yes, but sshhh, let's play along. Let the designers think that they manage to dazzle us every single year with their new creations. Nothing is "new", remember? So, here we are, surrounded by these beautiful floral dresses, tops, and yes, even handbags and shoes. Admittedly, I will draw the line at floral trousers. I have looked at dozens of them in shops and online and have not found one pair that would do justice to a woman's figure or style. So they remain a style non-non for me. However, if you beg to differ and have found a fantastic pair, please share a photo with us. This would be the equivalent of finding a unicorn grazing in your garden. From what I notice everywhere, everyone seems to own at least one floral top or blouse. As you may have noticed, I am a fan of versatile clothing. You know, these pieces that you can wear with everything, anytime and which always look great. Versatility is an important quality in clothing. Many of us do not have the luxury of buying new clothes and shoes every weekend. So, when we do buy something new, the clever thing to do is to make sure they will earn their keep, so to speak. This makes sense if you want a wardrobe that works. Pieces should go with as many others as possible. This makes it easier to create outfits first thing in the morning. If nothing goes together, how long will it take to get dressed? It is with this spirit of making clothes work harder, that I have chosen two skirts, two pairs of trousers and four pairs of shoes that will go nicely with one floral top or blouse. The jeans, skirts and shoes that I picked are also versatile in themselves, as they go with many items from your wardrobe. You can wear these shoes with each of these four outfits. The exception, I think are the black strappy heels. They don't not go well with the navy skirt or the white capri trousers. All these pieces are classics. They go with most things and will be worn for many seasons. They are items to own for sure.

You are here: Home / Travel Tales - Island Escapes / Thailand Travel / Cocktails simply taste better 56 floors up! Earlier this month I had a 1 night stop over in Bangkok and as the sun began to set and cocktail hour beckoned, my partner and I decided to head to the urban chic alfresco Red Sky Bar, located on the 56th Floor of the Centara Grand at CentralWorld. Despite the initial hiccup of finding how to get to the bar (FYI enter via the Centra Grand entrance on the shopping centre ground floor, take the lift to the reception area (23rdfloor) and then swap lifts to the 55th floor and ask for directions) this is a fabulous way to see out an afternoon and mark the beginning of the evening in this vibrant city! As you sink into either your comfy lounge chair or onto your day bed (located away from the main bar area – you need to request these if you prefer them, subject of course to one being available) and the really friendly waiting staff bring your cocktail list, all of the day’s stresses dissipate. And as the city underneath you lights up as the sun sets, and the silky melodies from the resident jazz trio float into the night sky, there are few better places in this city to enjoy not only the spectacular view but also your Happy Hour 2 for 1 drinks (5-7pm. Buy one drink and get your second free but everyone must buy the first drink however). You can dine here if you wish (and I would argue that the city view from the tables is better here than at some of the other well known alfresco restaurants in Bangkok) or from the adjacent (but indoor) restaurant Fifty Five. Reservations at either are essential and prices are equivalent to that which you’d pay in fine dining restaurants in Australia. But regardless of whether you wish to dine here or not, a sunset drink at the Red Sky bar is an absolutely delightful experience and a very relaxing and cost effective way to enjoy the incredible 360 degree city views. It’s definitely on our list to do again next time we are in Bangkok on a balmy, clear evening! If sipping cocktails in the sky takes your fancy then contact our expert staff and we’ll assist you or your travel agent, put together your ideal Bangkok escape! Our team have visited Thailand 5 times in the last 6 months so let our experience benefit your holiday experience!
This summer, the School of Nursing welcomes its first palliative care fellows through an initiative funded by a $6.5 million grant from the Helene Fuld Health Trust. Designed to serve as a national model, the Fuld Palliative Care Fellowship Program aims to develop nurse leaders to serve the growing number of Americans who face life-threatening and chronic illnesses at every stage of life. Fellows will immerse themselves fully in care initiatives, research, and policy development by working with clinical experts at the Emory Palliative Care Center. The grant provides for the admission of two fellows to the school's Accelerated BSN/MSN program each year. The fellowship program targets second-career students who often have seen how chronic illnesses affect family members and friends. "In health care, we're doing a great job of reducing sudden deaths from trauma. We've also improved infectious disease management. But as we age, it's chronic illness that we're prone to, which doesn't align with a health care system that is focused on dealing with acute illness," says Carolyn Clevenger 72MN DNP RN FAANP, director of the fellowship program. "We want fellows who are really passionate and have a drive to focus on palliative care for their careers." Working with Clevenger are HIV/AIDS nursing researcher Marcia Holstad PhD FNP-BC FAANP FAAN, who will guide fellows on their research, and Tammie Quest MD, director of the Emory Palliative Care Center. "Palliative care nurses are central to the success of our interdisciplinary clinical teams and the delivery of comprehensive care," says Quest, the Roxann Arnold Professor in Palliative Care Medicine."These fellows will be role models to others to ensure that patients and families facing serious illness have the highest quality care focused on quality of life." To learn more about the Fuld Palliative Care Fellowship Program, contact Clevenger at 404-712-2394 or carolyn.clevenger@emory.edu.

Not your average picnic potatoes, this no mayo potato salad is an easy cookout recipe. Southern French Potato Salad is tangy and delicious with a dijon mustard salad dressing. A yukon gold potato salad that will perk up your next barbecue or potluck. When it comes to cookouts, picnics and potlucks — I usually cede the Weber to my husband or other worthy grillmaster while I tackle the sides. As far as cookout recipes go, a good potato salad still ranks in the top 10 in my book. My Southern French Potato Salad is probably in the top 5 because it’s a no mayo potato salad recipe… and ideal for summer alfresco dining. These lovely picnic potatoes aren’t heavy or goopy. In fact, they’re delightfully light and zippy thanks to a douse of white wine, briny capers and lots of fresh herbs. The best part is that French potato salad recipe is really easy to assemble. Start with the potatoes. I like Yukon Gold, but any waxy potato will do. Bring the spuds to a boil and simmer until tender. Drain the water from the pot, cover with the lid and let the potatoes steam in the pot. When they’re cool enough to handle, peel off the loose skins and slice them into rounds. It’s the hard-boiled egg (and celery) that make this French potato salad a Southern French Potato Salad. Folks in the South like eggs in their potato salad — it’s an unwritten but long accepted rule. Having grown up in Virginia, I’m not immune to those cultural dictates — and thus I always make potato salad with eggs. To add a subtle flavor and moistness to the potatoes, sprinkle on a few tablespoons of dry white wine and chicken broth to the still warm potatoes. Carefully toss the potatoes to coat and let them sit and soak up the liquids while you prep the vegetables. Most French potato salad recipes use scallions and/or shallots and both work nicely here, but in the summer when I can get a good sweet onion, I like to include them in the mix. Finely diced celery adds a little crunch and it’s in keeping with my Southern roots and chopped capers give a briny little bite that ties this dish together. The BIG thing that differentiates a French potato salad from a Southern potato salad is the mayonnaise — as in — there isn’t any. Instead a French potato salad uses a dijon mustard salad dressing that coats the potatoes without getting goopy or heavy. Whisk together the dijon, vinegar, salt and pepper and then slowly drizzle in the olive oil until you’ve achieved a creamy emulsion. It’s simple and delicious over the warm potatoes . Add the chopped vegetables and hard boiled eggs to the sliced potatoes and pour on the dijon mustard salad dressing. Toss in the chopped parsley and dill and gently toss to coat. This Southern French potato salad can be served warm or at room temperature. If you do chill it, bring it to room temperature before serving. The flavors are so mild that you’ll lose the subtle flavors if the potato salad is too cold. I served this at a big family lunch last weekend and everyone loved it. A great alternative to mayonnaise-based potato salads and perfect for picnics and cookouts. I call it "Southern" French potato salad because I've added egg and celery (typical Southern mix-ins) but you can skip them for a more traditional French potato salad. In a large stock pot add the potatoes and cover with cool water. Heat over high heat until the water comes to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 20-25 minutes or until the potatoes are tender. Tip the pot to drain all the water then place the lid on the pot and let the potatoes steam (off the heat) for 10 minutes. Place the eggs in a small sauce pan and cover with water. Bring water to a boil and cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat and let the eggs sit in the hot water for 10 minutes off the heat. Run under cold water, then peel eggs. Meanwhile, chop the celery, onions, scallions and capers and transfer them to a bowl. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, use a sharp knife to peel the loose skins from the potatoes. (Don't worry if it doesn't all come off, you just want to remove the loose bits. Slice the potatoes into 1/4" thick rounds and transfer to a large shallow bowl. Sprinkle potatoes with wine and chicken broth and toss carefully with a spoon, trying not to break them apart too much. Let the potatoes soak in the liquids for a few minutes. Meanwhile, make the dijon dressing. In a bowl, combine the dijon, vinegar, salt and pepper and whisk to combine. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil, whisking constantly to form an emulsion. Set aside. Add the chopped vegetables to the potatoes and drizzle over the dressing. Add the dill and parsley and lightly toss to coat. Serve warm or at room temperature. This is my kind of potato salad! I’m honestly not a huge fan of the mayo versions – they leave me feeling so heavy. But this sounds fresh and wonderful! This looks and sounds ridiculously good, Lisa! I’m French, and I’ve never even had French potato salad, let alone make it. I fail. I need to rectify this stat. This sounds so tangy and refreshing. I love the addition of capers, and with a mustard dressing like that, who needs mayo? It’s funny—growing up I was *huge* into creamy sauces and dressings. I still appreciate a little shmear on a sandwich or burger, but when it comes to salads anymore, not a chance. Give me ALL the vinaigrettes. This is just the type of potato salad we would enjoy. We don’t like the heavy mayo covered potatoes you can’t taste anything else. We really like capers so this side would be perfect for our picnics and bbqs. “The BIG thing that differentiates a French potato salad from a Southern potato salad is the mayonnaise — as in — there isn’t any.” Yippee! I am not a fan of potato salad with mayo so this recipe is right up my alley. I love eggs in potato salad as well. Bookmarking this for sure! I love how you mixed French and Southern traditions together in this potato salad! It looks like you took the best of both and put them together for a great BBQ side. And no mayo makes it even better since that is one less thing to worry about when you’re eating outside. I’ll be sure to have the salad room temp when I make it. Potato Salad is a favorite dish of mine and this recipe looks heavenly. I love how there is no mayo, but the white wine and Dijon mustard must give it the perfect light flavor. I am definitely making this with our next cook out. I’ve never had capers in my potato salad before! I want to try this ASAP. I’m all about potatoes so I’m going to have to eat this like, tonight! Definitely pinning it! I can’t tell you how I love your Southern FRENCH potato salad Lisa, although I’m Swiss from Geneva we’re close enough to France to share a lot of recipes. I’ve always had potato salad with your dressing and that’s the way I love it. We also dip the potatoes overnight into a mixture of broth and wine to keep them whole. Since I moved to live by the Mediterranean sea, I’ve started adding a few shredded anchovies. Oh now I’m craving for a potato salad! You’re the second person that has mentioned soaking them overnight — that’s very interesting — and I think the anchovies would be perfect too. Thanks, Michele. We brought this one to a picnic last week and there wasn’t any left! that dijon mustard dressing sounds incredible! I love that this is a non-creamy potato salad and it uses eggs. So yum! I will have to try this one at my next potluck or BBQ! We love potato salad and are always looking for different variations on it. The dressing sounds amazing. Oh I agree! Gimme all the eggs in my potato salad! This recipe is delightful, pinning to make, as potato salad is THE perfect summer side dish. I love the addition of eggs in the potato salad and it looks fantastic I would devour the whole bowl ! we all would. OMG am loving EVERYTHING about this salad. From the wine, to the capers…and of course the dill. This is going to be a hit at my next BBQ party. Printing right now!! I love potato salad but I’ve never had it like this. It looks so good, I have to try it!

_get_lc_time() returns the address of the time filing system entry for the locale named locale_name, or NULL if the entry was not found. The implementation of each locale category must supply a selection function as shown in Table 4.7. _get_lc_ctype() Returns a pointer to the first element in a user-defined array that holds character attributes. See _get_lc_ctype(). _get_lc_collate() Returns a pointer to the first element in a user-defined array that holds sorting attributes. See _get_lc_collate(). _get_lc_monetary() Returns a pointer to the user-defined __lc_monetary_blk structure. See _get_lc_monetary(). _get_lc_numeric() Returns a pointer to the user-defined __lc_numeric_blk structure. See _get_lc_numeric(). _get_lc_time() Returns a pointer to the user-defined __lc_time_blk structure. See _get_lc_time(). C header files describing what must be implemented, and providing some useful support macros, are given in locale.h and rt_locale.h. For each category, changing locale is achieved by changing a pointer into the read-only data for the locale category. Except for default locales, the data must be user-supplied. All locale blocks for a category are collected into a read-only, position-independent, in-memory file system structure. The C library provides a set of macros to create the blocks and the _findlocale() function to search the file system. You can define a set of runtime selectable locales by using the supplied re-implementations as a starting point.

DETROIT - DaimlerChrysler AG said on Wednesday that investor Kirk Kerkorian's $8 billion lawsuit over the 1998 merger that formed the automaker should be thrown out because Kerkorian waited too long to file his claims that the "merger of equals" was actually a takeover. In a motion for summary judgement that offered its most detailed defense yet, the world's fifth-largest automaker said it had sworn statements from 11 of the 13 former Chrysler directors who approved the merger backing DaimlerChrysler's motion to halt the lawsuit. The lawsuit was filed by Kerkorian, and joined by other investors, after an October 2000 statement by DaimlerChrysler Chairman Juergen Schrempp that the $36 billion merger between Daimler-Benz and Chrysler Corp. had only been billed as a merger of equals for "psychological" reasons, and he had always intended Chrysler to be a division of DaimlerChrysler. In a statement, Kerkorian's holding firm Tracinda Corp. called DaimlerChrysler's statements "gratuitous and irrelevent." "The essential position put forth by DaimlerChrysler...is that Tracinda and the other shareholders should have discovered earlier that the transaction was not a merger of equals and that they had been intentionally deceived by Daimler-Benz and Mr. Schrempp," Tracinda said. Both sides have been filing a stream of motions before a Delaware judge, who is expected to rule on motions for summary judgement this year. Kerkorian claims Schrempp and Chrysler Chairman Bob Eaton dubbed the deal a "merger of equals," when in fact Schrempp was seeking to relegate Chrysler to a division of DaimlerChrysler. But in addition to defending the accuracy of its statements, DaimlerChrysler said Kerkorian and his associates had little interest in how Chrysler would be goverened after the merger. It also said Kerkorian believed Daimler-Benz was offering the best price for Chrysler shares, and worried that a higher "buyout" price might cause the deal to fall through. Citing many news reports between 1998 and 2000 rebutting the "merger of equals" language, including those surrounding the departures of several Chrysler executives, DaimlerChrysler also contends Kerkorian knew of the shift within the company, but did not care enough to take any action. Kerkorian launched the lawsuit, which could lead to bad publicity for DaimlerChrysler if it goes ahead, just as Chrysler was slipping into the red in 2000. Since then, DaimlerChrysler has pumped in at least 3.0 billion euros ($3.22 billion) into its U.S. business and sent German executives to oversee a turnaround. DaimlerChrysler shares have lost about two thirds of their value since the "merger made in heaven," as the company then described it, was announced.

“Using Twitter instead of command-and-control (C&C) servers is pretty innovative for an Android botnet,” says Lukas Stefanko, the ESET malware researcher who discovered the malicious app. Malware that enslaves devices to form botnets needs to be able to receive updated instructions. That communication is an Achilles heel for any botnet – it may raise suspicion and, cutting the bots off is always lethal to the botnet’s functioning. Additionally, should the command-and-control (C&C) servers get seized by the authorities, it would ultimately lead to disclosing information about the entire botnet. To make the Twitoor botnet’s communication more resilient, botnet designers took various steps like encrypting their messages, using complex topologies of the C&C network – or using innovative means for communication, among them the use of social networks. “These communication channels are hard to discover and even harder to block entirely. On the other hand, it’s extremely easy for the crooks to re-direct communications to another freshly created account,” explains Stefanko. In the Windows space, Twitter, founded in 2006, was first used to control botnets as early as in 2009. Android bots have also already been found being controlled via other non-traditional means – blogs or some of the many cloud messaging systems like Google’s or Baidu’s – but Twitoor is the first Twitter-based bot malware, according to Stefanko. “In the future, we can expect that the bad guys will try to make use of Facebook statuses or deploy LinkedIn and other social networks”, states ESET’s researcher. Currently, the Twitoor trojan has been downloading several versions of mobile banking malware. However, the botnet operators can start distributing other malware, including ransomware, at any time warns Štefanko.

(AllHipHop News) Nipsey Hussle's influence on the South Los Angeles community he served will go down in U.S. history. That is because representative Karen Bass of California made a commitment to guarantee his philanthropic work will formally become part of the Congressional Record. “I will be heading to the House Floor next week to formally enter Nipsey Hussle’s contributions to South Los Angeles into the Congressional Record where it will be a part of United States history forever,” Rep. Karen Bass promised. The hip-hop star and activist, real name Ermias Davidson Asghedom, was gunned down outside his Marathon Clothing store in Crenshaw, Los Angeles on Sunday, March 31. Eric Holder was taken into custody by Los Angeles County Sheriff's officials in Bellflower, California on Tuesday (April 2), hours after Los Angeles Police Department chief Michel Moore urged the 29-year-old to turn himself in during a press conference. Holder has since been transferred to an LAPD jail, where his bail has been set at just over $7 million. Meanwhile, a funeral for Nipsey Hussle is slated to take place this Thursday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. That's WAY BEYOND Dope!!!! In the past No elected official Black or White would even consider doing anything like this! It shows how much Hip Hop has changed people & the people who grew up with it! 20 years ago no TV network would've ever green lit a show with Martha Stewart & Snoop Dogg on it together. Look around Hip Hop is in commercial's, TV shows, Movie's, everyday slang! RIP Nipsey!!!!

Our staff is friendly, caring, and ready to help give you and your family the smiles you desire. Keeping teeth healthy through professional exams and cleanings are key to maintaining a healthy smile. Cosmetic dentistry can bring back form, while restorative dentistry brings back function through fillings, dentures, and dental implants. Deep tooth problems like small fractures, hidden canals, and calcium deposits can be relieved through endodontic surgery. Your gums need care just as much as your teeth. Periodontic care treats inflammation and diseases, such as gingivitis. Sedation can take the anxiety and discomfort out of a dental visit. From cleanings to surgery, sedation dentistry will put you at ease. Whether a tooth is knocked out or the pain of one prevents you from eating and sleeping, we can help restore your mouth back to good health. Pediatric dentistry provides the same level of care and services for children that is given to adult patients. Preventative dentistry is the crux of healthy teeth. Most insurers emphasize this point, often providing total coverage for a certain number of preventative and diagnostic procedures per year. The biggest benefit to having dental coverage is the peace of mind that comes with coverage for high-cost procedures. From fillings and root canals to crowns and dentures, dental coverage will help manage the cost of dental procedures. We aim to be the best affordable dentist in Houston, and dental insurance makes this even more possible. Whether you just need a cleaning, or you’re in need of emergency care, restorative work or endodontic and periodontic care, dental coverage will put a smile on your face before you even step into the dentist’s office.

In the Hagadah we say that the Jews in Mitzrayim stood out. Our Chazal inform us, this was because of three of their actions; they did not change their language, their names or their style of clothing. I therefore decided to use this story for Shabbos Hagadol. As noted in last weeks’ story, when Malka came to 770 for her yearly meeting with the Rebbe, almost every year she would receive guidance from the Rebbe in regards to enhancing her observance of Shabbos and kashrus. In this weeks’ story we will find out about the one time the Rebbe “visited” her, in her town. I am writing it in first person as this is taken from Malka’s correspondence with me. As I noted previously, all my audiences with the Rebbe, besides the first one when I went with my parents into his [yechidus] room, were by a nod or a glimpse as he walked down the final two steps onto the sidewalk as he was going into the car. He told me that he has a small package containing matza for me from the Rebbe. I asked him how he found me, and why would he think that I am the Jewish person he was searching for? He replied that the Rebbe told him to bring matza to this village and to give it to the [single] Jew living there. He was given no name or address or any other information. But as a follower of the Rebbe, he accepted the mission and set out to fulfill it. When he arrived in the village, he started to ask the Gentile people if there is anyone Jewish in the village. Nearly everyone he asked answered that there is no one Jewish in this village, as I never told anyone that I am Jewish. Finally, he met a few people who said that they suspect I might be Jewish because I am the only person in the village that does not ever attend the community church. The funny thing is that I was always invited to go to the church and join my neighbors. The social pressure was building and I had decided that I will attend church that coming Sunday so that I will fit in with the rest of the people living in the village. I figured it is no big deal; I am a Jew and will always be a Jew. Attending a church once in a while in a social setting, and not as a religious act, won’t change that! It was exactly then, that week, that I had decided to go to church the coming Sunday. It was a week or so before Passover. And that was when this rabbi showed up at my door! It made me think hard and deep: The ONLY way he found me and the ONLY “sign” that I am a Jew is that I don’t attend church. Do I want to really give up that sign??? If I attend church I DO lose something huge: my identity as the Jew in this village. Yes, it is going to change things and in a big way. It was at that moment that I decided to keep my identity and sign of being Jewish and NEVER go into the church. It was the one and only time that I received something from the Rebbe – he knew I needed it at that moment and he was sending me a message that he is watching out for me. The greatness in this was twofold: If he would have asked the messenger to deliver it to me by name, I would never have received this important message. I would have been happy that he sent me something, but not necessarily would I have connected it as a message to not attend the gathering in the Church. Secondly, he allowed me to understand it on my own, without telling it to me straight out. It was my decision and resolve, not his. I maintain this resolve till this day, decades later. Just a few months after [my adopted parents passed away and] I decided to rebel against all mitzvos, I visited the Rebbe. It was shortly before Pesach. The Rebbe reminded me that I promised to keep Shabbos and therefore I cannot do any melacha forbidden on Yom Tov. The Rebbe smiled and said something like, “Yom tov is also called Shabbos”. The Rebbe gently, yet firmly demanded and insisted, and I had to acquiesce. He didn’t leave any options. There were no compromises. As stubborn as I was, he always won the “debate”. As a personal note to the readers of this column, a story without a message is a wasted opportunity. My personal message to readers: These days I hear there are many young people who are angry, let down and disappointed by real or perceived trauma. These young people are turned off and choose to rebel. Many go “Off the Derech” (a cliche I read plenty about) and live a self-destructive physical and spiritually suicidal life. I say to them and their parents, I have been there and have done that too. If anyone feels angry at G-d – it is me. I was orphaned twice: from both of my birth parents whom I never knew and then sixteen years later, from my adopted parents whom I loved. I had one anchor to being Jewish and that was my annual visits to the Rebbe. However, I lost that one anchor too when I lost the ability to see the Rebbe. As an Orthodox observant young teenager I gave up on Judaism and chose to live away from it all – I moved to a place with no Jews. But, I keep connected to the Rebbe as I promised years ago. I visited him then at 770 and now at his grave site annually (and the graves of both my sets of parents), and I keep Shabbos and kosher, as I promised years ago. (I am now building an eruv around my property to enjoy the longer Shabbos days outdoors with a book and only kosher snacks). I feel I have a right to be angry (as many of you also feel)! I am rebellious! But I am still a daughter of G-d and the Rebbe told me that G-d loves me no matter how angry I am at Him. I keep my promises of observing Shabbos and kosher without procrastination, while I wait for Him to finally keep His long overdue promise to take us all out of this painful exile. I suggest to the youth (and those older) who are angry: Consider coming (at least) once a year to visit the Rebbe. I visit and I cry the whole time until there are no more tears, and then I leave behind the pain as a comfort settles on me with a feeling of being connected to something greater than me. I am uplifted from despair as I internalize the message that the Rebbe told me so long ago, that Hashem is my parent and that even this rebellious daughter is loved by Hashem. One day, maybe I will understand why, maybe not, but life is not just about me, for as I learned in Hebrew Day School, if I live only for myself – what am I? By myself I am insignificant. When connected to something greater than us, you and I will reach greater heights. Therefore, I advise and indeed implore you; even if presently you are rebellious and angry, be connected to something greater than your individual self. I celebrate Passover alone without any family as they were taken from me and I chose to celebrate alone away from any other Jews. I, the Rebellious Daughter, ask of you the Rebellious Son or Daughter (no son or daughter is really “wicked” – just rebellious, and may sometimes feel fully justifiable to rebel), to come join whatever family you have for the Seder. Appreciate that you do have family, and join their Seder because the Seder has a special place dedicated just for you. After all, we are one of those Four Sons/Daughters, who belong at our family’s seder table. I will always be a daughter who is loved by Hashem.

The walk is not long but consists of many ups and downs with numerous stiles. Starting from the Flowerpot, in Mirfield, the route heads to Boyfe Hall, Hollin Hall and Hopton Hall. The walk continues with the Hall theme travelling to Lascelles Hall via Cockley Hill, onwards to Lepton and Paper Hall Farm, returning via Whitley and Briery Bank to the Flower Pot where after walk libations can be taken. There are a few sections of the walk on back roads but its mainly on field tracks and footpaths and bridleways. The underfoot conditions are generally good but there are inevitably some muddy sections following rain.

In April 1995 – to the weekend exactly 22 years ago – I went to the first event by the young antenna AEGEE-Skopje, a conference about privatisation. It was my first visit to this magnificent country with great people, but not my last one. I came back for a marvellous Travelling Summer University the next year plus the two Agoras organised by the antenna. But the memories of this first event were very special. This is the story. My trip to Skopje couldn’t have started worse. And I was so enthusiastic about going to the capital of Macedonia, where AEGEE-Skopje was about to organize it’s very first event, the congress with the too long title “Privatization in Central and Eastern Eu­rope with a special view on Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia”. After the Agora I went to Eindhoven. I knew some members there, because AEGEE-Eindhoven was the twin antenna of AEGEE-Szeged, when the concept of twin antennae did not exist yet. When I told one big bald guy that I wanted to go to Skopje, he enthusiastically said: “Yes, you must go there!” It turned out that he helped the young contact antenna a lot to come into existence and organise its first event, because his former girlfriend was one of the founders. Three days later, I was on the train from Budapest to Skopje. I studied in Szeged in Southern Hungary at that time and my Hungarian friends told me that visa were not necessary to go to Serbia. Well, not for them, but for me being German, yes. So I waited in the train station of Subotica, slept on the wooden benches, where some Canadians with the same fate were stranded, and took the train back to Budapest the next morning. There was still time to go to Skopje, because it was only Thursday and the conference programme started only on Friday, 14th of April 1995. However, the train was late and I arrived to the Serbian consulate at Heroes’ Square just five minutes before closing time. All employees of the consulate were coming right out of the building already and did not even bother to look at me when I asked them about a visa. So I took the next train to Szeged and came back the next morning. This time I got the visa, hopped on the afternoon train, changed in Nis in the middle of the night and arrived to the Serbian-Macedonian border at 5 a.m. The train was actually supposed to go to Skopje, but it didn’t. All passengers went to a bus station where a Serbian guy, who spoke German, told me which bus to take, where to change to another bus and how much to pay. The bus drivers were driving their buses like Formula 1 cars over the curvy roads, but I didn’t mind, because at 10 a.m. I reached Skopje. The time, when the conference programme of the second day was about to start. At the bus station I called one of the organisers from a public phone – at that time no one had mobile phones. He picked me up and took me to the Faculty of Law, where the event took place. Finally I could enjoy the conference. The topic of the event was quite fashionable at that time. In most countries in Central and Eastern Europe the privatisation of state-owned enterprises was in full swing. There were different models. While most governments sold the companies to foreign investors, who had the financial resources and knowledge to make the old companies more successful and get their products successfully on the market, other countries sold the companies to their citizens with the help of vouchers. In some countries the governments sold the companies to friends or themselves. The conference organisers got some very prominent speakers, which was no surprise, since one of the members was the daughter of the finance minister. Among the speakers were (surprise!) the minister of finance, Jane Miljovski, and the director of the Agency for Trans­formation of the Enterprises, Verica Hadzi-Vasileva Markovska. During the afternoon of day two there was a panel discussion on “The privatization process and the flow of people, ideas and capital”. When I arrived, I had no clue that I would be among the panelists! After I entered the room, one of the organisers came to me and said: “You are from Germany, right? So you know about the privatisation in Eastern Germany, right?” “Ehm, well, yes, something, why?” “Two of our panellists cancelled and we need a replacement so that we have at least three people. Just tell me what you know and I’ll ask you questions about that.” And so, I became speaker at the event. It was going fine, but I was so glad when the panel was over… The whole congress was followed by national TV every day, and there were reports of the results in all major newspapers – which showed again what great contacts the organisers had. This second day was also the end of the serious programme of the event and the whole group left next morning for Ohrid, the magnificient old town at Lake Ohrid in the west of the country. The group of about 25 foreign plus 20 local participants plus more local organisers went to this great city of literature, culture and history together by bus. After checking in at our hotel, we visited all kind of great cultural places, of which the famous monastery was the most impressive one by far. Just one year before the conference, the Oscar-nominated anti-war film “Before the rain” was shot there, which we watched together with the whole group on video. Later on, we also visited the already privatized brewery of Skopje, where we had the opportunity to see how the privatization worked in practice. It was the beautiful place and even more the amazing and friendly spirit of the organisers from AEGEE-Skopje that caught our hearts. So it was no surprise that nearly all participants spontaneously decided to stay one day longer. No one was in a hurry anyway. Eight of the participants came from Turkey, another eight from Bulgaria; they were extremely relaxed about their timetable, and we, the others, were mainly from Slovakia, Germany and France and wanted to find out as much as possible about this great place in the company of the great organisers. For us time didn’t matter anyway, since it was Easter that weekend. Among the Turkish participants was Refet Saban, one of the founders of AEGEE-Ankara and later CD member. An amazing person like everyone from the Turkish group. It was a shock for us to hear that one Turkish girl died a few months later in a car accident, with also other member from AEGEE-Ankara being in the same car. He also gave us a great sightseeing tour, where he told us a lot about local politics and culture. I remember clearly when we went to some viewing point over the city and he pointed at the minarets of the ethnic Albanians in Skopje. “You see the minarets? Their number doubled in the past ten years”, he said. “Now Albanians are 40 percent of our population.” He looked very concerned of becoming a minority in his country. He was also concerned for the unstable political situation and the hostile relationships with their neighbours Yugoslavia (Serbia-Montenegro) and Greece. And of course the relationship with Albania was also very bad. So it was no surprise that UN peacekeeping troops were stationed in Macedonia, which helped stabilising the situation.
I have used a picture browser for Joomla known as ImageBrowser. It is good - easy uploads, simple for clients to make use of, even handles zip file uploads. I've Joomla v. 1.5.15 installed and also the latest version of the wordpress plugin too on three or four in our sites without any fuss or issues. Lately, the ImageBrowser on our sites began acting oddly. It had been as though the Lightbox effect that people must have disappeared completely. I in comparison the configurations for that site to a different and located these were identical. I could not take action within the documentation or forums. Here's the URL to check out: http://neda.us/photos?view=gallery&folder=BSU+12-5-09. You are able to compare that to a different in our sites with similar wordpress plugin and configurations at South Oak Flooring us dot COM. You need to have the ability to click a thumbnail and obtain a complete size look at the look inside a Lightbox. Any help necessary and far appreciated. If the library itself eliminates jQuery conflicts is yet another matter, however the above should still work fine. I simply launched a brand new version from the Image Browser component. This latest version should address this problem in addition to fixing a couple of other bugs and enhancing security. Tell me when the latest version works not surprisingly. error while performing "apache services" Exactly why is my $_ENV empty?

After two decades serving Haligonians, Tom’s Little Havana will serve its last customers by the month’s end. The owners of the building – who also own Rasa Flavours of India next door – will be expanding, re-branding, and opening a spot called Sura Lounge. With the restaurant’s Tom Wile no longer around, the family behind Rasa wanted a change. “Tom is no longer on the scene, and this is no longer a Havana. This is a long overdue change,” said co-owner Deeksha Bhaskar. Tom’s moved from Doyle Street to Birmingham in 2015, and Bhaskar and her father took over Tom’s & The Fireside in 2017, turning the latter into Rasa. Now, the new concept for Sura Lounge will feature Indian cuisine, and will be a complement to Rasa. The last day for the Havana is March 27, and will say goodbye to the old, and welcome in new brands for the taps, including Garrison and Good Robot. There will be an auction, hosted by Dan Hendricken, where popular Tom’s items will be sold. A portion of the proceeds will go to Enactus Saint Mary’s program Square Roots. While some will mourn the loss of Tom’s Little Havana, co-owner Bhaskar is looking to the future. “While change is bittersweet, it’s also inevitable. It was time for a change,” she said.

The internet dating industry is constantly evolving to match the needs of it's users. Today internet dating is one of the most popular things that people do on the internet. More and more people are turning to internet dating to find a meaningful relationship. If you play sports and you're seeking an activity partner you can do that on an internet dating service. If you are looking for someone for a serious relationship, or you are looking for a pen pal who lives in a different country, you can accomplish this on a dating service. These dating services are great because they give you the opportunity to community with people who you may never meet in the real world. In the internet dating industry there are 2 types of services there are the free services and the paid services. Based on my own experience I would advise you to avoid using the free services because many of these services are popular for harvesting spammers. Joining one of the paid services is much better, it will cost you some money to upgrade your membership but it's worth the price. The paid services will give you more control, more features and much less spammers. Here are some tips you can follow if you are just getting started with internet dating. First you need to find an internet dating service that you have confidence in, some dating services will provide video training as well as a FAQ section. You should take full advantage of this and use it to your benefit. Then you will need a decent profile, if you're not sure what to say in your profile you should read some profiles from other members on the site. Try to find some good profiles, then you should implement some things from those profiles into yours. You will need a good picture, for your profile the importance of having a good picture is sometimes overlooked by many members on dating services. If you don't have a good picture you should get one taken. It is important that you do not rush this process, all to often people do not take their time when creating a profile. Having a bad picture or having typos in your profile can have a negative effect on you, this can be a huge turn off to other members. It's best to take your time when creating your personal profile on an internet dating service. Please visit fitness singles if you would like to know more about fitness dating.

Commercial roofing is an expensive investment. As such, it deserves your care and attention. Unfortunately, many building owners find repairs and ongoing maintenance to be a hassle. They forego proper care. However, the faster you catch a problem, the less expensive the repair process. Over time, even the most stalwart of commercial roofs may develop issues. In fact, a replacement may be needed if you don’t act fast. Standing water is a frequent problem – typically caused by clogged or blocked drains. Often, standing water is due to poor roof design or installation, though. Allowing water to remain may cause extensive leaks, which can be costly if not taken care of. Before repairs commence, it’s important to find the source of the water. Sometimes it’s as simple as locating a blocked drain. New roofing penetrations compromise the sanctity of commercial roofing systems. Unless you take proper action, these penetrations or punctures can lead to considerable damage and increased costs. For single-ply or spray polyurethane foam roofing systems, damage from foot traffic is often the primary cause. A penetration often leads to underlying harm, leaks, and reduced efficiency. When a commercial roof is improperly installed, roof blow-off is a genuine possibility. Blow-offs mainly occur during severe storms and high winds. All it takes is one corner or chunk of the membrane to lift upwards, and the wind is trapped underneath. Uplift and blow-off damage is considered severe, leading to water damage, ruptured membranes, and underlying issues. It’s important to inspect your roof after every major storm, just to be safe. If you’re uncomfortable doing so, call a professional roofing company to handle the task. For commercial roofing services, contact Peak Roofing & Construction by calling (972) 335-7325 (Dallas/Ft. Worth) or 281-290-7325 (Houston). In fact, give us a call today to secure your commercial roof with professional repairs.

Stubborn disease of citrus, caused by Spiroplasma citri, is an important disease of citrus in the hot, arid inland areas of California and Arizona. The two methods most commonly used for detection of stubborn have been biological indexing and culture in a cell-free medium. Indexing for stubborn disease of citrus is difficult since it requires the somewhat tricky side-graft or leaf vein method, and it takes several months to obtain results. Culturing is also somewhat time consuming, sometimes requires several attempts, and can produce false positives from contamination. Culturing is the test of record for CDFA and most regulatory agencies. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has proven to be a valuable medical diagnostic tool for investigating damage in humans. This tool is useful in medicine since it provides information on “soft tissues” in the body such as muscles and tendons. Our project was focused on developing magnetic resonance for use in detecting damage to “soft tissues” in oranges. The goal of this research was to reduce economic losses to the lemon industry due to postharvest decay and to increase postharvest quality and storage life of lemons using the inexpensive naturally-occurring compounds spermidine, spermine and salicylic acid applied as a dip or drench after washing or in the storage wax. If successful, the research would identify a less-expensive material that is as effective or more effective than GA3 combined with 2,4-D. The goal of the robot harvester project’s second phase, FY2004-2005, was to begin to validate Vision Robotics’ concept for mapping orange trees using the scout robot. The scout will map the grove determining the tree locations, the number and size of the oranges and their approximate positions on each tree. Once a tree and its oranges are mapped, the scout will determine a picking-plan for that tree, which it will transmit to a harvester robot. During the second year of this project, we continued the work initiated last year. This project uses the sensory panel volunteers at the UC Kearney Ag Center to evaluate early season navel oranges with the intent to develop a database of the relationship between SSC/TA ratio, volatiles, and acceptability of navel orange fruit. Additionally, during this year we explored the relationship between fruit handling practices, waxes and fruit acceptability following storage. This research investigates the efficacy of ozone combined with carbon dioxide and vacuum to control bean thrips in navel oranges. A focus of this work in 2004-2005 was effects of wax type and cultivar to mitigate phytotoxic damage. The goal of this project is to develop and test a field method for using an ethanol sensor to measure whether a sample of oranges contains a threshold level of freeze-damaged fruit. The citrus industry is seeking an objective alternative to the manual inspection method used by CDFA inspectors to determine freeze damage in navel oranges. The purpose of this project is to develop new methods to control postharvest decay of citrus for use in California packinghouses. Practical experiments with the newly approved postharvest fungicide pyrimethanil (PYR) were completed in 2005. PYR has recently been approved for use in California to control green mold, caused by Penicillium digitatum, though acceptance of its residues in some overseas markets is still in progress. In the summer of 2005, fludioxonil and pyrimethanil were registered in California following the federal registration in the fall of 2004 for postharvest use on citrus. The postharvest registration of azoxystrobin is still pending but is expected in the summer of 2006. In Sept. 2005, we successfully placed propiconazole into the federal IR-4 program to establish a residue tolerance for postharvest use, and these studies are planned for 2006. Vision Robotics (VRC) has demonstrated that it is possible to see all the oranges (>99%) on trees in production groves from somewhere outside the tree canopy. In practice, this requires a thorough scan of the tree canopy, and the closer to the canopy and wider the viewing angle the better.
My daughter loves to do crafts, and we figured what better way to break-in the new craft table in her playroom than to do a fun Easter craft together! I was inspired by this post that Kelly (not me) posted over on The Pretty Bee. Kelly and her son made some cute Easter egg decorations with strips she cut out of scrapbook paper with her paper cutter. I don’t know the age of her son, but my daughter loves to cut paper, and it’s a good readiness skill for Kindergarten, so I just handed her a stack of pastel office and scrapbook paper and let her go to town cutting the paper into strips. I printed out an Easter Egg template that I had from last year on to white card stock, and I cut out the center. Then we glued the strips on to the back of the template. On The Pretty Bee, Kelly glued the strips to a plain piece of cardstock and then put the template over it at the end, but I somehow missed that detail. I wish we would have done it that way that way though, because I think the strips would have stayed down a little better. She also glued them horizontally, but my little artist wanted them to be vertical stripes, so that’s how we did it. The one fun part about doing it upside down though is that we could only peek and see how it was coming along. When we were all finished, Andrea flipped the paper over and gasped and said it was “sooo beautiful”! It was priceless. I love how excited she gets about her crafts and artwork. I’m not very artistic myself, so I wasn’t sure what I’d think of the crooked cuts on her strips of paper, but I actually think the imperfections from having her cut it on her own really make it unique. To give it a little more structure, I then glued a solid piece of cardstock to the back of it. That’s when I realized I should have done it differently in the first place, but oh well. Here’s the final product (before I trimmed the excess paper off). All in all, it was a very fun and successful afternoon/evening of crafting I thought. Andrea can’t wait to do another Easter craft on her new table, so I’m sure we’ll be doing more over the next few days. We moved last August and since the move, I’ve never taken the time to get my combined office and craft really functional. It had too much furniture in it, and needed more shelving. Last Friday, I had enough and started changing it all up. I was going to post about the progress I’ve made in that room, but instead decided to focus this post on the first thing I changed, which actually involved a table that I moved OUT of the room. Moving the table out and freeing up that corner of my office was the first step and it made a huge impact in my room. And I was so excited about how it turned out that it motivated me to keep working on the rest of my office. In our old house, we had a pretty generic kitchen table with the natural wood top and white painted legs (similar to this). I bought the table shortly after graduating from college for cheap at a discount furniture store, but it worked, and it actually looked pretty nice in our last two houses. But the new kitchen has darker wood floors and cream colored wood trim, so the table was just NOT going to work anymore as our kitchen table. So I had the movers put it in my office/craft room, thinking I could work on craft projects with my daughter there. But that never happened, as she preferred to work in her playroom. So the table just took up a lot of space in my office and junk got piled on it. I also realized Andrea was outgrowing her little kiddie table that Santa brought when she was just 2. Brainstorm! I realized I could cut the legs down and move it into her playroom. It’s got a lot more real estate than her kiddie table, which is never big enough for her sprawling arts and crafts projects these days. The only problem was that I didn’t like the idea that if I cut all the legs, I couldn’t easily put it back to its original state again. So I went to Home Depot and looked for replacement table legs, but they were pricey and would have cost over $60, which was more than I wanted to spend. But then I found some primed square balusters for only $9 and they were long enough (42″) that I could buy two and cut them in half to make shorter legs for the table. So I brought them home, pulled out the circular saw and cut them in half. Then I took the legs off the old table, lined up the new legs, marked and drilled holes in them, and then screwed them in to the table similar to how the original legs attached. My daughter LOVES it. She has so much space for her projects now and there’s room for her bins of markers, and crayons, and colored pencils to be on the table with her while she works. The table is also a little bit taller than her previous table, so she won’t outgrow it anytime soon, and it’s a little easier for me to sit with her so we can do projects together. Success!!! The office/craft room is coming along quite nicely, but I will have to post about that later this week.
Dean 'Rocket' Hall is waiting until the dust settles before talking about DayZ updates. The War Z's implosion inspired a lot of chatter, little of which Dean 'Rocket' Hall, creator of zombie Arma 2 mod DayZ, has been able to avoid. In a Reddit thread titled 'in light of the recent events surrounding The War Z, I think it's more important now that Rocket and his team take their time with the standalone', Hall stepped in with a quick statement about how things were going, and what he was up to. Saying he was depressed about the situation, Hall announced that there would be no updates about DayZ's progress until after everything had gone back to normal. Health issues and personal worries meant that, for his own wellbeing, Rocket ought to keep things quiet for a while. I know I have been very quiet lately. So this will be really all I'll say for the moment. I've been pretty depressed about the whole situation. From a personal standpoint, this whole "saga" of the development made me seriously question if I wanted to be involved in the industry and I gave serious thought to cutting my losses and not being involved in the project. At my Army Discharge medical this week, they noted I now have high blood pressure. Some things in life just aren't worth worrying about. I've been getting hammered by a massive amount with requests for information about DayZ release, interviews and my reactions to this and stuff and such - but for my own sanity I retreated and have kept to myself. Right now I'm just at home doing bits and pieces on the DayZ development. The rest of the DayZ team is doing the same. I realize that I went back on my word about releasing an update, but went back into my shell for a bit last week, and I'll come out when the dust is all settled. The DayZ standalone had originally been scheduled for launch by end of 2012, but recently Hall said that the date may slip to 2013.

Our Sweet Tooth: Melting Chocolate For Decadent Desserts and Confections! Melting Chocolate For Decadent Desserts and Confections! When using chocolate for desserts it is often necessary to melt it before hand to achieve the textures you want in your confection. There are some tricks to melting chocolate that you need to be aware of before you begin. It is a bit of a delicate process because chocolate burns easily over direct flame. There are basically two methods for melting chocolate. One is in a double boiler and two is in a microwave. A personally prefer the double boiler method over a microwave, but I will discuss both techniques for option sake. Both ways are effective as long as you are focused, paying attention to the task at hand. It takes a bit of patience for sure, but once you understand that it needs slow, steady heat and frequent stirring you are ready to begin melting. The point that chocolate melt is between 86-96 degrees, but it needs to be brought up in temperature slowly. Keeping the chocolate in constant motion while heat is applied is important. This ensures even melting and that a skin does not form on the top. Dark chocolate is easier to melt that milk chocolate because of milk fats and solids that coagulate with heat. The general rule is to not heat dark chocolate over 120 degrees or milk chocolate over 115 degrees. This technique provides a kind of cushion that protects the chocolate from close contact with the heat source. A double boiler is basically a glass or stainless steel insert that sits over a pot of heated water. Double means there are two kinds of pots involved. You can use an actual double boiler, which you can buy. Or you can make one by placing a stainless steel bowl over a pot of water, fitting it inside so it is in contact with the hot water. When melting your chocolate make sure the water level is no more than an inch so no water gets into the chocolate. Turn the heat on low and bring it up to almost a simmer. Place enough chocolate inside so you are still able to stir it appropriately with a rubber spatula. It is important not to "boil" the water. When the chocolate is halfway melted turn off the heat source and allow it to continue while you stir it. Be sure not to cover the pan, this will create condensation and water in your chocolate. This is a simple technique which involves chopping the chocolate into pieces and placing them in a microwave safe bowl. Use low power and turn on for 15 seconds and then take out and stir it. Repeat until the chocolate is close to melted. With this method it is hard to see if chocolate is actually melted because it still might retain a shape, the inside might be done but the outside just needs to catch up, so beware! It just takes a bit of practice to get these two main methods of melting chocolate down. But once you do you can then create all kinds of exotic desserts and treats for friends and family. There are literally countless ways to use melted chocolate; most cookbooks have at least a few recipes. Soon you will be a professional chocolatier making all kinds of amazing confections to delight in.

At LVISD, we are dedicated to providing a safe and secure environment for the students, faculty, staff and visitors on our campuses. In order to support that commitment, we have a comprehensive emergency operations plan that addresses emergency mitigation/prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery procedures relevant to natural and human-caused disasters. The plan is updated annually, reviewed by staff as well as emergency response personnel, and shared with campus and department staff, and with other individuals who may have a role in the event of an emergency. The plan prepares our staff and students for action and establishes teams, chains of command, and specific steps to take in an emergency situation. We are ready to provide for the safety and security of your children and others if the need ever arises. As part of the plan, each campus practices fire, evacuation, reverse evacuation, exterior lockdown, full lockdown, safe shelter and bad weather drills throughout the year. This allows our district administrators to be sure that faculty/staff and students know the correct procedures in the event of an emergency. Additionally, at LVISD, we are in partnership with local law enforcement agencies who provide school resource officers for our campuses. • Enter and exit the building through the main entrance when visiting a campus. • Always sign in at the front office to ensure that parents and other visitors are properly identified. • Leave entrances and exits locked at all times. Exterior doors should not be propped open. • Continue to be timely in picking up your child after school and after school functions so as not to leave the child waiting outside for a ride. • Listen to your local television/radio stations and check the district website (www.lvisd.org) for information. • As soon as possible, the district will activate its emergency call line to place a phone call explaining the situation to you. Please listen carefully to the message. There will be limited personnel available to answer phone calls from parents and phone lines may become overextended. Calling the school will tie up the phone lines and disrupt the flow of vital information between the school and authorities. • When schools are in lockdown, please do not come to the school. A lockdown is designed to keep the children and staff inside the building away from harm. Entrances to the school are to be kept locked during this time. • If your child reports to you that a drill took place at his/her campus that day, please take the opportunity to discuss the importance of drills and safety precautions. • In the event of an emergency, students will be released to their families as soon as it is safe to do so. Local response personnel will determine when it is safe for the schools to begin releasing students. Only an authorized person as noted on the student forms on file in the school office will be able to pick up your child. A driver’s license or other form of photo I.D. must be shown before staff can safely release your child. Note that in the event of an emergency, phone calls authorizing a student’s release to a person other than a parent or name on file will not be accepted. • If the need arises to implement these safety protocols, cooperating with campus personnel in a calm manner will ensure safe and timely release for students. Please notify your child's campus office staff with any changes in address, home phone number, cell phone and office numbers. We want to keep our parents informed of any emergency situations.

What Is Balayage & Is It For You? Balayage is a French word meaning ‘to sweep’ or ‘to paint’. In its truest form balayage is a highlighting technique from root to tip that creates a sun-kissed natural look on any hair colour. It is quicker to apply than foil highlights and lower maintenance; so you can have beautiful lived-in colour that lasts for up to 12 weeks – and in some cases even longer. The beauty of balayage is that it works with the natural fall of your hair and your own natural variations of tone to create a bespoke look that’s fresh and modern and totally tailored to you. Balayage is all about soft contrasts that add movement and dimension for an effortless wearable look. It’s a freehand hair painting that uses no foil or meche to create either a very natural looking highlight or a more dramatic contrast, but your colour should grow out very softly without any harsh lines. If you want to have on-trend hair that looks naturally sun-kissed rather than obviously coloured, balayage is the best choice for you. Balayage can work for all hair lengths from crops and bobs, through long bobs (lobs) to long layered hairstyles. It is also becoming increasing popular for men’s hair colour. Jack will work with you to create the bespoke hair colour that will accentuate your hair and your best features. Is balayage just for blondes? There is a bit of a myth that balayage is just for blonde hair. It’s not the case. Balayage is a highlighting technique that brightens and adds contrast to all hair colours. The key is to choose tones two or three shades lighter than your base colour. As well as his blonde clientele, Jack is renowned for his French browns and his balayage for red heads and has been at the forefront of the key trends for hybrid colours including bronde, ronze and rose gold hair colours. For clients who dare to be a little more creative with their colour choice, balayage can be applied in more dramatic bold hues or pretty pastel tones for Instagram-friendly colour bleeds and melts. Every colour appointment begins with a thorough consultation with Jack at London salon Paul Edmonds. You’ll discuss your hair and how your currently feel about it before discussing exactly how you would like it to look. Get ready to answer some questions about your lifestyle, and how much time you are ready to commit to your hair and its upkeep, so Jack can personally tailor your colour so it suits your look and your life. The initial colour consultation is a professional and paid for service that is essential to creating your perfect hair colour. The cost of the appointment will be deducted from your next service. The bespoke colour will be mixed exclusively for you and is hand-painted onto the hair based on the natural rise and fall of your locks and any natural colour variations. Jack will consider where the sun would naturally highlight your hair and what will best complement your features and accentuate the shape and texture of your hair. For short hair, including balayage for men, or just one or two pieces the balayage may sometimes be applied at the backwash. Over the years Balayage applications have changed and there are now four different types of application under the banner balayage: Classic, Creative, Micro and Californian. For classic balayage application the product is loaded on the mid-lengths of the hair section, feathered up to the root then spread down over the surface of the section, and saturated on the ends to create a seamless finish. It’s the Victoria Secret girl look; perfect for longer hair, with upkeep every 8- 10 weeks. For creative balayage the product is also loaded on the middle of the section of hair and only feathered slightly up the hair shaft for a more lived-in finish, leaving the roots in their natural form. The ends of the section are still saturated. Perfect for darker bases who want some lightness but nothing near the root, equally lovely on any colour because of it’s lived-in look. Great if you want lower maintenance colour, or simply like a ‘rooty’ feel. Micro Balayage is a finer, more delicate application which works well on all hair colours. It works exceptionally well when wanting to achieve a heavier coverage of colour and when transitioning from foil highlights to balayage. It’s also perfect in fringes and is great for guys who want a sun kissed look. It goes all the way to the root and is great on bobs and shorter hair. This type of balayage needs upkeep every 8 weeks. Californian balayage is still very soft at the root with a much heavier coverage through the mid shaft and ends. This look achieves a more visible result through the mid-lengths and ends of the hair, and is the look most seen on Instagram at the moment. It works well for people who want to be blonde and is a high-maintenance look. Californian balayage works well with root stretches or root smudges and can also be achieved by merging classic balayage with ombre. Balayage is low maintenance hair colour that often has a ‘rooty’ lived-in feel to it. There is no obvious regrowth so you can expect results that last much longer than foils highlights or block colour. However, to keep the vibrance and longevity of your colour, Jack will recommend the professional shampoo and conditioner that is tailored to your hair type to reduce colour fade. You should also avoid excessive heat on your balayage pieces and always use a heat protection spray before using irons or tongs. Many colour clients choose to visit Jack in-between their balayage appointments for a glossing treatment to brighten up their look. Whether it’s an at-home colour that didn’t do what it said on the box or you didn’t get the desired result at another salon, Jack is skilled in the art of colour correction. Jack also has decades of experience in how to transition his clients from old-fashioned foil highlights to on-trend balayage. Paul Edmonds, 217 Brompton Rd, Chelsea, London SW3 2EJ. T: 020 7589 5958.
To reach new levels of security, safety, comfort and entertainment we need to embrace the idea of computer vision in the home, rather than shying away from the idea of sharing personal data. Computer vision allows computers/systems to understand what they “see” via digital images or video. When systems can detect and recognize objects, they can deliver smart actions according to what they were programed to do. One area that has effectively proven how computer vision can enhance our lives is the automotive space. Car systems that utilize computer vision to learn the driver behind the wheel and “see” the surrounding area can alert the driver when he starts swerving out of his lane. Many consumers are already using computer vision on their smartphones and don’t even know it. Snapchat and Instagram are both using computer vision-tracking to detect facial features and place overlays (filters) in the right places. Welcoming computer vision into your home and adding it to your connected devices will enable a new level of convenience to your everyday routine. Your front door will be able to “see” when you arrive and unlock the door for you, or remain locked when an unfamiliar person (face) approaches. The alarm systems will be smarter, able to detect specific members of the family (including age and gender) and who’s not. Taking it a step further, indoor security cameras will send an alert to your smartphone if an elderly family member or guest falls, or if a toddler is climbing up the stairs, on the countertop or anywhere that places the child in danger. Nest, Logitech and other smart home manufacturers have already started to offer these smart security features to consumers as a subscription-based premium service, or already embedded them in their newest products. When your home can see and has the capability to learn, over time it will be able to adjust lighting and temperature to the number of people in any given room to ensure a comfortable environment and potentially save you money on your electric bill. Your fridge will be able to “see” when you are low on milk and eggs and send you an alert to make sure those items are added to your grocery list. Imagine a cable box that greets you by name and turns on a tailored interface with the content you like. Imagine not having to watch ads that are not relevant to you in any way, and a TV that is smart enough to block inappropriate content/channels when it detects kids in the room. Imagine a system that notices your significant other is sitting next to you on the couch and suggests content that will be enjoyable to both of you. These are examples of how your home and media reacts and adjusts to you. You become a true master of your home and providing data gives you access to new capabilities and information previously unavailable to you. Activities and services that you may want to monitor in addition to security system alerts (for example, sensing who is at the front door to unlock or sound an alarm, and monitoring your children or activities in home). For the first category, there is no need for the computer vision systems to save, show or share any video and visual content. All that is needed for the systems to work is real-time data reporting to the relevant systems, and the output should be X people in room, age, gender. To customize media content, an output stating the relevant family members in front of media device is necessary, but no visuals are needed. This can and should be embedded, which means no videos or images are sent to the cloud, the camera shouldn’t save any imagery locally and the camera itself shouldn’t be connected to internet — all computer vision calculations should be done in real time on the device itself. If the above rules are met, the computer vision technology is embedded on the device and your concerns about privacy should be resolved because the hackability of the system is extremely low. Regarding the second category of computer vision systems, you have a need and desire to monitor and see what is happening in your house, so the privacy protection measures with the home security cameras should be implemented here as well. Once again, the deeper understanding and seeing capabilities of these systems do not require processing in the cloud, internet connectivity of the sensor or saving of images. It is you that wants to view it, so the risk with these enhanced capabilities will be no different from the ones faced today in this sector. With the capabilities of IPTables Linux can be locked down in very specific ways for example limiting communication to specific IP addresses that allow it to operate safely in high threat environments. I've seen articles about migrations to Linux desktops that cite benefits other than cost recently. As an example, the Linux desktops on the International Space Station are being used for stability and reliability reasons. Other migrations, like the Munich city council one, have been done to gain greater control over IT infrastructure with cost savings being a notable fringe benefit.

Costco vs. Sam’s Club: Which Wholesale Retailer Fills Your Shopping Cart? Stocking up on everything for the office, from coffee to paper clips, can be a lot for office managers to keep up with. However, going to wholesale stores makes this task a lot easier. When buying office supplies in bulk, not only do you make fewer trips to the store, but you end up saving the company a bit of money. But which one should you go to? We’ve paired megastore Sam’s Club up against its main rival, Costco, to see who comes out victorious as the ultimate superstore. We’ve compiled the facts, but we’re leaving the decision up to you. So look over each section, then vote for your favorite wholesale retailer in the poll below.

Our very good friend Tom Siering donated a night of ice cream to the Sled Rangers for one evening after practice. The ice cream came from Morganstern’s Finest Ice Cream. We had the ice cream delivered up to where we were practicing at Lasker Rink, and we had 20 gallons of ice cream to pass around between about 30 athletes who played that evening. This was really a special treat for all the kids (and including one overeager grandmother!), and it really shows in the photos. Thanks again to Tom for helping to sweeten our hockey season!

Protect Florida Small Business is a coalition of small businesses, organizations, and individuals who have joined together to advocate on behalf of the thousands of small business owners and operators who run franchise stores, restaurants, and shops across the Sunshine State. These franchisees are our neighbors, dedicated men and women who chose to invest in a small business in order to pursue their dreams. This website is a resource for Floridians to learn more about the unjust treatment facing franchise operators and how to support and foster local business growth through leveling the playing field. Florida laws already provide safeguards for car dealers and agricultural equipment dealers, leveling the playing field if manufacturers attempt to take over or close down their dealerships with little or no notice. Thousands of other Floridians invest their personal savings or take out loans to achieve their share of the American Dream – so why shouldn’t the owner of a small sandwich shop or oil change and repair shop receive the same treatment? Small business owners should be allowed to run their stores without having to worry that their livelihoods could be ripped away without ample notice or fair compensation. With a more balanced franchise relationship, both parties can grow and create jobs for Floridians.

After submitting your form, you will be redirected to my calendar to schedule your strategy call. Words of love from my clients. "Before hiring May as my coach, I worked as an administrative coordinator at a tech company. I was working in my dream industry, but I wasn’t being challenged in my role and felt incredibly frustrated. The admin job was meant to get me by while I built up a tech portfolio and finally got the experience I needed to get hired in a “real tech job” after that. But it felt like it was going to take years and years. I felt like my career was stalled because of my employers, because they didn't understand my talents. But May helped me to realize that I needed to take ownership of my dissatisfaction with my career. She didn’t sugar coat anything, and helped me to really focus on what I wanted in my career, and create a step by step plan to make it happen. After every call with May, my dream career – which had seemed like a pipe dream – felt more and more achievable. I decided not to wait – I quit the admin job that wasn't working for me and focused all my energy on the tech jobs I’d always wanted while building my portfolio and networking at the same time. Now I’m an Account Manager at a tech company! I’m so happy that I’m finally exactly where I wanted to be in my career, instead of staying on a career path that didn't make me happy." I decided to work with May after feeling lots of ups and downs in my work life. When I got a “win” at work, I would feel on top of the world, but if something didn't go my way, I often felt crushed and burnt out. I was trying to do “all the things” instead of focusing on what really mattered to move my career forward. In working together, May helped me find my creative voice, trust it, and nurture it and finally create a lifestyle that sustains me instead of burns me out! This is a big deal for me, as I’d been dealing with burnout and exhaustion even while gaining more material success and acclaim in my industry. The coaching made all the difference in my transition to a new level of success in my career and I can't wait to work with May again!

The government's decision to grant citizenship to Bangladeshi immigrants in Assam has also created political rights for them including the right to vote, the Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind (JUH) on Monday told the Supreme Court. After Shiv Sena sparked protest by demanding disenfranchisement of Muslim community, a party leader said Sena has never misused power while in Government. Sakshi Maharaj demanded that a strict law for family planning be brought in for all and those who do not follow it should be stripped of their voting right. According to the provisions of the Representation of People Act, when government servants and a class of certain other persons are allowed to vote through postal ballots, then the same right be given to private persons who are forced to leave their respective constituencies for reasons of employment. SBI Chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya today said they could look at issuing shares with differential voting rights to raise funds to meet the Basel-III capital adequacy norms. NRIs should be granted voting rights. This can be done either by mail or by voting in the respective nearest consulate," a memorandum submitted to Modi in a meeting with Overseas Friends of BJP (OFBJP) delegation said yesterday. India's plan to increase voting rights for shareholders in banks would improve management and corporate governance but it falls short of lifting ownership restrictions or relinquishing the government's stranglehold on most lenders. With the government staring at a slowing economy, triggered by a lack of reforms, the announcement could bring some cheer to investors, but needs to be cleared by parliament.
Rutva Solanki will begin second grade at Trailwood as a Junior Olympic Stacking medalist. Solanki is a member of the Trailwood Stacking Club and learned to stack in physical education classes. Solanki placed second this summer at the World Sport Stacking Association Junior Olympics in his age division. “This is definitely a unique and well-earned recognition,” Kathy Zink, PE teacher said. Speed stacking involves stacking 9 or 12 specially designed cups in pre-determined sequences. Players compete against the clock or another player. The sport is included in the elementary PE curriculum and can be played as an individual or team sport. Solanki participated in the Shawnee Mission districtwide tournament and advanced to participate in the Central Region Tournament in Wichita last May. This was a sanctioned tournament that follows protocol established by the World Sport Stacking Association (WSSA). If a competitor qualifies for the finals in a sanctioned tournament, he or she receives an invitation to the Junior Olympics. Solanki’s family accepted the invitation and signed him up for the Junior Olympics hosted in Des Moines in July.

One can spend only so much time surfing in 30C+ weather ;). So while my body was recovering from too much sunshine I decided to play with Hadoop to learn first hand what it actually is. The easiest way to start is to download a preconfigured VMware image from Cloudera. This is what I did and it worked but it did not work well. The highest resolution I could set was 1024x768. I installed the VMware client tools but they did not seem to work with the Linux distribution picked by Cloudera. I managed to figure out how to use vim to edit text files but a tiny window with flaky UI (you can see what is happening inside Hadoop using a web browser) was more that I could handle. Then I thought about getting it working on Mac OS X which is a very close cousin of Linux. The installation process is simple but the configuration process is not. As far as I know Microsoft is going to to contribute their changes back to the Hadoop project so at some stage we might get Hadoop running natively on Windows in the same way nodejs is.

In remarks during the Feb. 12 Board of Education meeting, members expressed their strong personal opposition to the amendment to House Bill 702, which would create a statewide charter authorizer. We knew something like this might be coming, and I think it’s regrettable. The same way I think it’s important for us to listen to the State, I also think it’s important for the State to listen to us. Our work is their work, and vice versa. I’m tired of the whole thing and I’d like for us to just start working together. However, if the legislature, in its zeal wants to go down this path, then I am personally ready to fight over this particular issue. I’ve worked in and around state government for 20 years. And my view is: This is bad policy. Regardless of what anyone thinks about the basic policy of what’s being proposed — to circumvent local school boards — there are other questions about the specific approach that’s being contemplated. First, I wonder if this proposal is constitutionally suspect. As recently as November, a federal judge in Shelby County took a step toward essentially voiding a state law that lifted the prohibition on new special school districts because the law applied only to Memphis and Shelby County. How the legislature thinks it can do this, on the heels of that failed policy and federal court intervention, is a little surprising. Second, I wonder what — if any — precedent there might be for the State to confiscate local taxpayer dollars without the school board or the Metro Council’s consent. It’s one thing for the State to drop a new policy or regulation on local jurisdictions. It’s something entirely different to take local resources without local consent. If the State wants to get in the business of running schools, have at it. But take 100% of the responsibility for it, financial and otherwise. So based on this fairly unprecedented step the legislature in its “wisdom” is taking, I think we need to step back and examine our options. I’m not a fan of litigation, but this is one where I think our hand is being forced and this has the potential to have long-lasting negative repercussions. So Madam Chair, Dr. Register, fellow board members: I’d like to get some legal analysis sooner rather than later. We’re hearing from people who have paid a lot of money to be involved in this discussion in Tennessee. I implore the legislature to listen to those who are impacted by this bill. Davidson County has a great record for high performing charter schools. We exceed the national averages in performance of charters and approval of charters. We’re open to innovation and have shown good management of charters. This bill would undermine our relationships with charter schools and cause “shotgun weddings” of charter schools in our district. We need collaboration for success. The only grossly under performing charter school in our district is one the state authorized outside of our control. This places an undue financial burden on our city. Charters are not at capacity here. This bill is a reaction to a disagreement over the quality of one charter.

Courtesy to Borneo Soap (Facebook: fb.com/borneosoap), I was invited to an exclusive trip to Kuching, the land where this luxury handmade soap is born. It was kind of a private "discovery" trip as the CEO only brought me and Kak Ella, another blogger from KL to Sarawak. Well, what is it to be "discovered"? Continue reading to know more! The morning flight was smooth, and we settled at Dormani Hotel before exploring the town. The sponsor was really generous to give us one room each, fairly decent and comfortable for me to spend a night staying there. Plus, the room has such strong WiFi connection that I can type a blog post during the night itself! Location wise, it is ideal for tourists and locals alike. Many tourist attractions are within walking distance from Dormani Hotel such as the popular Sarawak Museum, the old City Mosque, Islamic Centre, Satok Market and Kuching Waterfront. The first place to visit is of course the Borneo Soap factory. I was excited as I had not been to any soap factory before, plus the one we were heading to was all about hand-making soaps! Time to be amazed with the excellent craftsmanship and quality ingredients. If you remember my first encounter with Borneo Soap last May, surely you'd have heard of the goodness of their organic soap and skincare products. Made of natural ingredients native to the rainforest of Borneo, they are heralded for their healing, therapeutic properties and long used by the indigenous people of Borneo in their bath and beauty rituals. From extracting the ingredients to packaging the soaps, I notice that attention to detail and quality is given to each and every blend of the organic handmade soaps. Despite of the painstaking process of getting the raw ingredients from the jungle and rural areas, Borneo Soap has never compromised with the quality as it believes in making rare gems that everyone can enjoy daily. The whole range of Borneo Soap products include body bath, facial bar, foot soap and feminine wash. All soaps here are enriched with Goat’s Milk and vitamins to provide a luxurious cleansing experience. Borneo Soap is now available at Metrojaya Mid Valley KL and Metrojaya CityOne Kuching. Online purchases via www.borneosoap.com will be entitled for FREE delivery within Malaysia. before attending a high-tea party in the afternoon and meet Syamin Jasmi!! Courtesy to CQ Music, we were invited to the exclusive preview of official music video "Lagi dan Lagi" by Syamin Jasmi, the first talent managed by CQ Music at Riverside Majestic Hotel. Syamin is a young homegrown talent from Kuching, and now he records his very first song! And gosh, he looks SO cute in real life! a famous local musician. Don't forget to watch his Youtube music video HERE! After a well-spent afternoon, it's time for dinner hunting in Kuching! I really wanted to try out the local Malay cuisine here, and the team recommends us Barong Tinuk (Tel: 082-237551 / 019-8188145), a local restaurant that offers loads of local delicacies which I probably have not heard before! Instead of the usual Nasi Goreng Kampung, we opt for the fried rice with exotic "black olive" famous in Sarawak. The dish is so simple, yet well-packed with fragrant Dabai flavours. Dabai is a seasonal fruit which you may only get them once in a year, so be sure to bring some home if you travel from far to Sarawak! I bet lots of Sarawakians have not heard of Linut! I am glad to try this traditional food by the Melanau ethnic group here. Freshly made of the fresh sago flour by mixing with boiling hot water, Linut has a very unique texture! Very gooey and sticky but not as thick as glutinous rice. Best served hot with a dip of spicy sambal belacan. Another traditional Melanau side dish is the umai that comes in a choice of fish or prawn. This reminds me of Chinese festive Yee Sang (鱼生)! Thick slices of raw fish should be well-mixed with shredded vegetables and zesty lime juice to get rid of the fishy odour. I'm surprised that the fish serves here is so fresh that I can eat them raw without any condiment/sauce. In fact, all the food items here are freshly prepared and CHEAP! If you're craving for some local tastes, this simple neighbourhood restaurant is highly recommended for family gatherings and casual meals. Well, that's the end of Day 1. Wondering what did I do in Day 2? I flew to another part of Sarawak for more adventurous journey!
Thanks Linda for all your hard work. My family and I would like to send a shout out to Linda for all the hard work she has done in helping us close a chapter in our lives.. My MIL passed away in a car accident last July in St Eustache.. well, we live in Atlanta, GA.. it was very hard being away, and not around to help with the selling of her home.. I contacted Linda and asked if she would take on the job. With my MIL's wonderful neighbors (Tracey&Larry) who were also her executors to her estate...(as we were too far away)..An era has ended.. her home was sold.. we are very pleased with how the whole thing went.. Thank you Linda, for all you have done.. we are happy and sad at the same time.
And here’s the finish that I just completed this morning. Last job before we take off for warmer climes over the holidays. Happy Christmas and New Year to everybody! Going to be taking a little time off for the holidays, and planning on being back in the office around New Years (the band’s got a NYE gig), then out again until mid-January. Work, of course, has begun to pick up in anticipation of my trying to leave, so I’ve spent the last few weeks frantically working to keep the time off from causing problems with deadlines. The above illustration is one I did this morning for Delaware Today (featuring likenesses of several Delaware-area women politicians). Below is a series of spot illustrations for Barrons (nice to hear from them again, it had been a while) that I did last week. Also this past weekend I had a couple of very busy days putting together a few more ‘comic strip ads’ for a local law firm (apparently the ones I did a few months ago have been a big hit and they want to make this an ongoing series). Several months ago I did a series of black and white scratchboard illustrations for Dover for an upcoming coloring book. Here’s a few samples from this collection (I may post a few more in the coming weeks). I also did a few ‘color’ versions of some of these illustrations for book cover usage, and may post a few of those as well. Stay tuned. And here we are at the final month of the year. A couple jobs from the final week of November, above is a caricature of Brent Musburger for Main Line Today Magazine (a new client, affiliated with the Delaware Today organization), and below is another fiction piece for Alfred Hitchcock’s Mystery Magazine (one of my oldest clients, my first assignment from them was in 1989). And speaking of Alfred Hitchcock’s Mystery Magazine; I’ve been doing illustrations for this publication since 1989, and I am looking for back issues from the years 1989-1998 in which my artwork has appeared. If you happen to have copies in your attic gathering dust, drop me an email, and I’d be happy to make an offer on them.

I cannot believe that I have been in France with my beautiful French girl, Odile, for over a year. I look back to the day I returned to France, in September of 1912, after that first visit with my father in the April. My unannounced return surprised her father, as well as startling the beautiful girl of my dreams. It was a comical moment, now I think about it. A lovely September day and I can remember almost every moment here in France with Odile since then. Here I am right now in our special little tool shed in Martinpuich. An odd space for romance I admit, but I suppose many things about our romance are odd. A cramped space, smelling of oil and dusty grime, but we both love that, so I suppose it’s fitting enough. I can look out the tiny window and around this small farming village, nestled between ridges in the lovely region of the Somme in northern France. In the distance is the road north from Albert to Bapaume. I can’t see the road from here, but it is the road that brought me here to this wonderful life in France. I expect the view from this window will always be wonderful and nothing can take that away, I am sure. I sit now and await the arrival of my beautiful Odile. The captivating free spirit that landed squarely into my life in April of 1912, a spirit that is now wrapped around my heart and soul, gripping me willingly tighter in to her and one which will not let me go. I am not attempting to resist, for I know now that I truly love her. Indeed, it was in this small space that I told Odile, in my terrible French. I do think it is getting better, it’s just sometimes, I forget the names of things. I am not yet sure if she feels the same way about me. I see by the way she looks at me, the way she moves around me, that I do mean something special. After all, I am a long way from home and she is happy for me to be here, so I suppose that must mean something. My French is still an engine in pieces strewn on the floor of this shed, but I do know she wants to spend her time with me and wonderful time it always is. Outside the shed is the equally wonderful and yet terrible motor bicycle that we have been using, to spend time with each other. We have finally made it work and the frames that I have put on to carry the vegetables and other items in my errand rounds are strong enough to carry my precious love in very little comfort, but with much fun to make up for that. We always end up smelling of petrol and covered in soot, but it is wonderful to spend time in the free wind with Odile, her hair unable to resist the breeze over the slopes of the Bazentin Ridge. Today is cold. Not the coldest I can remember, but the roads are covered in mud, which freezes into ruts and this makes getting about on the motor bicycle probably dangerous, if I was actually riding it. But I don’t much in December. I am spending most of the time pushing it along as it either does not start, or slides around in the mud, throwing me off in to the fields for a soft landing. I have now lost count of the number of clips around the ear from the village families, angry with dirty cheese and bread, with fingermarks and mud coating the parcels. Still, most give me a smile and a coin as well, once I tell them how hard it has been to get to them at this time of year and I always get to them, just the same. Today, Odile is coming to meet me, to help get the motor bicycle back home again, with at least some of the bread still in a fit condition to eat. She is late, as usual and it will be dark soon. I will write her a note in English, hide it here as I often do and hope that she will understand it well enough. Sharing notes here is something we have always done. It is exciting and I can say how I truly feel without my clumsy French making me look a fool yet again. I get quite enough digs in the ribs with the usual ‘imbecile’ to last me quite well enough. Her notes are in English and French, to help me learn the French language on the page, which I struggle with all the time. I expect she will be here in a half an hour or so, so I can at least make a start. It is nearly Christmas now and about time I finally learned of her feelings and showed her my deepest soul, now hers for all days. Darling Odile, my beautiful French love from over the sea. I am always too shy to say the things I really feel to your face in my terrible French, so I want to say this to you, right now, in the cold of this tool shed but in the warmth of your love. It is nearly Christmas in 1913, a time of year when we can say how we feel, without fear and so I take this chance to say these things to you. I wish every moment to be with you, I have some coins in my pocket from my errands, wages earned in the desire to stay here in France with you. I worry that I must return to England, worry that if I did, we may never be able to get to be here, like this, again. Perhaps in the future, we can see the things we have planned in our heads take their place in this world for real. I will, I promise, learn French enough to take lessons as an engineer. I will travel to learn the skills and then be able to make and repair my own machines and to solve problems by inventing devices. This I will do. For you, Odile, are truly my love. I look into your eyes and realize this is where I want to be. There will be nothing in the future, I am sure, that can take us away from each other, nothing that can break our bonds of love. This is my hope. I do hope that you feel the same about me, or this may be a wasted heart, walking the halls of life empty, cold and shrouded in a great darkened cloak. Christmas in 1912 was new and exciting. I was away from home and it all passed by so quickly, I can scarcely remember. This year, I have a plan for you and I do hope that you enjoy the surprise I have made for you, my all time love. As usual, I wrapped the note tightly and placed it in the usual not-so-secret, secret location. This tool shed was not used often by the owner, this corner never at all, in my opinion. I don’t think he knew we used this place. It was a good place, on the road from Bazentin towards Pozieres, on the rise in the ground sweeping away from the Bazentin Ridge. Odile now arrived, very cold and now hungry. I looked at the two parcels left to deliver and decided that one of the bread loaves could be spared. ‘Yes Odile, the cold is starting to get to me. You take the parcels and I will push this blasted motor along’. ‘I will, William, but now you must only be speaking at me in French, how is that? You must learn my language, Mr William-not-the Conqueror’. I had to agree. I had to give my French another chance to disappoint. ‘Let us go Odile, it is weather for us to about turn’. ‘William Collins, you are the worst French speaker I have ever known. Will I ever get you to speak, silly English imbecile’. We both laughed, but I was no clearer what went wrong with my French. Anyway, off into the afternoon, just as it began to get dark. We arrived at the last house on my round for the day. It was on top of the slight hill on the edge of Bazentin-le-Petit village, where the road curves away to Pozieres and down into the village itself. Odile lived in the farm opposite the church, although her father was an engineer and not a proper farmer. He had a number of strong and friendly lads working with him, mostly older, married men from the village. They always looked out for Odile, as a daughter of the village and made sure I knew my proper place, where that was concerned. I was happy to be here and

In many ways ethics can be about making judgements or assessment about what is right or wrong, good or bad. But are all judgements the same? Recently there has been an ongoing story in the press about a mother who lost her child in during a freebirth. This event was naturally a deeply tragic one for her and her family, despite the apparent non-recognition of this in the news. The coroner’s inquest and associated media coverage was a rampage of judgement to condemn this mother for what had occurred for her. What amazed me was the total lack of compassion for the mother and her loss. As if losing her child was not enough pain, a number of people saw it best to condemn her for it. This ‘double punishment’ seemed to be built on the principle that judgement and condemnation is the perfect right of anyone, and there are no situations by which judgement should be tempered with empathy or compassion. In our modern world, we have a tendency to judge all matters with a scientific lens, as if all matters are purely scientific. Birthing seems to have become a medical procedure rather than a rite of passage or important life event. Is it though? Should we really boil all things down to simple scientific views. Life has far greater complexities that warrant looking beyond simplistic viewpoints, binary answers, or clear cut rights or wrongs. And just because we were all born once, does that make us experts in making determinations about how others should give birth? It it not surprising that we are so good at judgement. Despite mainstream spiritual teachings being grounded in compassion and love, contemporary interpretations often speak of a ‘judgmental’ God or Judgement Day. Even the process of interpreting spiritual teachings is less about sharing perceptions than it is about making definitive judgements. Our modern day school system also teaches judgement from the early years, with performance rankings, rights, wrongs and strong labeling of children around their talents, skills and supposed deficiencies. In many ways we live amongst a world of judgement. Do we learn however to make distinctions between different types of judgements? It is one thing to make a judgement of ourselves, or indeed make a judgement of a situation in terms of whether it is safe or good for us. Are these judgements that we make of and for ourselves ethically the same as making judgements of others? When is it right to make judgements of others? When is it that another person’s actions or life crosses into our territory? I can understand situations like murder, stealing or other actions that encroach directly on the freedoms or space of others. Does the situation of home birthing really do that? Here is a choice made by a mother about having the best possible birth experience. In this case it did not work out the way it was planned. There is a load of evidence that home birthing is a healthy, effective and safe choice for families. In this particular case, some might say that in making judgements they were defending the rights of the child. There are equally tragic stories to death, pain, loss of dignity and intrusion into a child or woman’s rights in the mainstream birthing or medical field. These situations are rarely treated with the same level of significance or judgement that has occurred in this case around freebirthing. Just because mainstream hospital birthing has greater legal and social acceptance than home birthing, doesn’t make it ethically better. Do we make these distinctions in our responses because one is actually better than another? Or is it because the one who is making the judgement holds different values? How much do our values interfere with making clean and objective ethical determinations? In sitting here and writing, I cannot say that I am an expert in either homebirthing, freebirthing nor a hospital approach. There may be a number of factors which I am not aware of which, if I had more awareness, would lead me to think differently about this situation. But this is my point. It really does not matter what I know or don’t know in some situations. Just because I have the capacity to make a judgement, it doesn’t make it right for me to share it, declare it or force it on others. Where a situation doesn’t warrant my opinion or judgement, I hope that I am able to practice discretion, compassion and empathy by keeping it to myself. I hope to allow people the spiritual freedom to live their lives and make their choices. I know that is what I would like from others. I want to acknowledge that when I first wrote this article I conflated homebirthing and freebirthing. It was pointed out by an early reader that there are strong distinctions between the two, including the associated ethical dimensions. I subsequently revised this article to clarify that. That aside, the article is not about making judgements of either. It hopefully explores the idea of how we judge others in any situation – I think this has relevance beyond the birthing field.

Did you know that blueberries can do wonders for your memory? Moreover, these berries can prevent memory loss. The results of a 2012 study showed that a single serving of fresh blueberries per week can slow the cognitive decline. Another similar study conducted in 2013, involving lab mice, revealed that berries protect the brain, because they have the ability to clear toxic proteins that tend to accumulate in the brain. But, that is not all! You can actually grow your own blueberries. Can it get better than this? We give you 6 easy steps on how to grow blueberries in your own garden. Blueberry bushes enjoy sun and proper drainage. Provide your bushes with well worked and weed-free soil. Give your blueberries enough water, as the plant grows best when exposed to constant moisture. So, you better have enough water on hand. Improperly or partially drained soil will not give you the results you need. Try raised beds. If you do now own a garden or live in a small apartment, patio containers can be of great help for you. Give your blueberry bush enough space, preferably two and a half feet in diameter, and a foot deep for every bush. Dig a fitting hole, and take out about half of the soil. Add an equal amount of pre-moistened peat moss. Mix it good. If you are planting your bushes in raised beds, use equal amounts of peat moss and rind, tripe or planning mix. Avoid cedar and redwood rind. Separate your bushes by 2-2.5 feet, or provide 6 feet space for one bush. If you are planting the bushes in rows, separate them by 8-10 feet. Spring and fall are the best planting seasons. However, in some areas in the world, blueberries can be planted in any season. If you use baby bushes, carefully pull out the bush. Next, rough up the cortical layer of the blueberry root. Add about half an inch more planting soil than the top topsoil. Harden the soil around the root, and add the rest of your soil. Water your baby plant really good. When it comes to wreathes, sawdust, rind mulch, grass clippings and acid tripe work best for this purpose. Blueberry bushes have shallow roots, which means wreathes are more than welcomed here. Add about 2-4 inches of wreathe to preserve the moisture, keep weeds away, and provide organic matter. Repeat the process every year, and remember, you should never use sawdust from cedar and redwood tree. This will strengthen your bush and give you bigger fruits. Once your bush starts growing, prune it regularly to make sure it is strong enough to bare its fruits. Clip off any flower that appears. Regular pruning will make your plant strong and healthy. Always use organic fertilizers. Blood meal and cottonseed work best. Manures may damage your bushes, so try to avoid these.
Monday, 20 June 2011, Grafenwöhr. It's an early first morning as the cadets rise for an MRE breakfast, don swim gear and collect plastic bags. The battalion arrives at the Grafenwöhr Schwimbad about 0630 to learn water survival techniques . . . how to remain afloat using your clothes. Active duty Soldiers from Vilseck's 2nd SCR show up to conduct the training. It's a chilly morning and most of the cadets are a little reluctant to go into the water, but they do it anyway. One platoon at a time cadets get into the shallow end, practice the techniques, and then swim to the other end of the pool. Non-swimmers wear life jackets. Once at the deep end, cadets are encouraged to take a large step to build self-confidence . . . that step is five meters off the surface of the water. One-by-one cadets climb the ladder to the top level of the diving platform and jump with yells such as, "Bravo Two!" . . . "Alpha One!" A number of cadets are very hesitent to jump, but afterwards emerge from the water with huge smiles. "I did it!" "That was really great!"

HomeBlogJob Search AdviceIs Resume Clutter Holding You back? Is Resume Clutter Holding You back? Recently Andrea and I moved into a new place, in a new city. We’re almost settled in, and getting into the rhythm of living here, but we still aren’t done unpacking quite yet. There are unopened boxes around the house that are mostly full of old stuff that need attention. We haven’t dug into them yet, but since we're mostly unpacked and have put everything we need in place already, I’m guessing they're full of items that don’t really have a place in our new life. So in a couple days, we’re going to block out a couple hours, go through the boxes, and recycle or donate everything that we no longer need. Honestly, it might be a bit of an emotional process, because I’m sure we’ll find items that bring up old memories. But sometimes you just have to clear out the clutter, let the past go, and move on if you want to embrace a new life, right? It’s all about moving forward. I think resumes are a bit like that too. Because, over the years, your resume accumulates achievements, certifications, awards, and skills that were important and served a purpose in the past, but they no longer will help you get a job. You may be proud of some of these items. Perhaps, even a little sentimental. But, just like us with our boxes, sometimes you need to clear all that old stuff out, because it's clutter that not only makes your resume look dated, but it can also get in the way of your success. The question is, how do you know what to keep and what to remove? Basically, you upload your resume, and the tool scans it with the same applicant tracking software that major employers use. Then it creates a profile for you and shows you how you would appear to just such an employer. If your resume has old junk that no longer has a place and is holding you back, this tool will show you exactly what you need to remove and what you may need to add. Take those suggestions and combine them with what I share in these emails, and you’ll be well on your way to sending out a stunning, modern resume, acing your interview, and landing your dream job sooner.
Many new biometric technologies and products have emerged in the last few years. Mobile biometric solutions offer multi-factor and strong authentication possibilities, as well as transactional authorization. Mobile biometrics will become an important architectural component in the financial services industry under the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2). However, there are several challenges with biometric authentication that implementers must consider.
The daylily's botanical name, Hemerocallis, means "beauty for a day", and indeed most daylily flowers open in the morning and die by nightfall. However, each flower stem (also called a scape) typically has at least a dozen flower buds, so the plant stays in bloom for several weeks.... Daylily Basics Plant in full sun for the most blooms. Daylilies tolerate just about any well-drained soil, but for optimal results, work in lots of organic matter (such as peat moss, chopped leaves, composted manure, and kitchen compost) before planting. They are rebloomers and will bloom more than once in a season. These daylilies bloom one to three weeks before the height of bloom of most cultivars. These daylilies bloom one to three weeks before the height of bloom of most cultivars.... If the winter is mild, those plants may grow quickly enough to produce flowers the following spring or summer. In the north, however, most daylily seedlings won't bloom until they are at least 2 years old. If you really want to grow a huge number of daylilies, you should definitely understand how to follow different daylily propagation methods. Some of the best methods that you can try to learn are dividing, seed propagation, proliferation and tissue culture. Previous Plant Next Plant >> Hemerocallis 'Whoopy' Daylily. 5" blooms are extremely dark purple with a black eyezone and a small, yellow green throat. Growing well in full sun to part shade and any well-drained soil, they’re perfect for novice gardeners and green thumbs alike. And you can have some flowering from late spring through fall by choosing early, mid- and late-season bloomers, as well as rebloomers.
Watertown’s Mark Mahowald hits a return shot during fourth-flight singles action against Pierre’s Ryan Warne during a boys tennis quadrangular at Huron on Saturday. HURON — It was a rough second day of action for the Watertown High School boys tennis team as the Arrows went 0-3 in a quadrangular. Watertown suffered a pair of 6-3 losses to Eastern South Dakota Conference foes Pierre and Huron before falling 9-0 to Sioux Falls Lincoln. The Arrows are now 1-4 on the season. Jacob Meester recorded the lone singles victory for Watertown against Pierre, topping Grant Judson 11-9 in the fifth flight. Sam Mahowald and Adam Kays (second flight) and Mark Mahowald and Meester (third) each earned narrow victories in doubles play. Veflin (first flight) and Dale (second) picked up wins in singles play against Huron and teamed up for the win at first-flight doubles. “The scores don’t look great against Lincoln, but we got more games this time around and all the kids competed hard,” said Zink. Already the second meeting between Watertown and Sioux Falls Lincoln, the Patriots secured another lopsided win. Dale fell 10-5 in singles action for the closest finish. Watertown is scheduled to play at Milbank Area on Tuesday at 4 p.m.

Good morning friends! I can’t believe how quickly this year is going, just 11 more days until we go into 2019. I’ve been blogging since June 2018, can’t believe that it’s been about six months since I began. As you all know I blog about Jaxson and his Dyrk1a Syndrome, Military Spouse life, Family life, and Health & Fitness. As the new year approaches, I’ve been thinking long and hard on what content I want to include on my blog. I do want to add a section of stories from Special Needs parents, I would love to share your story with everyone. I’m pretty excited about this. I have already reached out to an Occupational Therapist I met via Instagram. Her and her friend have a podcast for Occupational Therapy and Sensory Processing Disorders. We are hoping to get together in February for this collaboration. I reached out to our Facebook group, For the Love of Blogging, to see if there were anyone who would love to do a Q & A style post with me and I got a good amount of hits! I’m including many bloggers with different type of niches, I think it’s awesome to support all bloggers. I am super eager to start working on it! If you’re interested in sharing your child’s story please comment below or email me at jacarfora88@gmail.com. I would love to hear from you! My goal is to get more awesome followers like you! Thanks for being there and I know you will reach all your goals! Thank you Linda! I’m glad that I found your group, it’s definitely been one of the most supportive ones! You will reach your goal too!!! Hi! Looking forward to reading these interview-style posts in 2019! And you’ve got some great goals going on! Mine are similar, although on a much smaller scale. These are great numbers for about 6 months in! Thank you so much Jackie! I can’t wait to see where I am in 6 months! In 6 months I’ll be blogging for a full year! CRAZY!! Let’s do this! I love to read about your goals because it gives me something to shoot for. Maybe you started with more than me but you have many more Pinterest followers than I have although I am up to almost 3K monthly viewers. You have been a big boost for me with your support. Thanks! Hey Sheila! Thank you so much. I did start out with a decent amount of followers before starting my blog in June. I am happy to help!! I can’t wait to do the interview post with you. I’m sure it will help bring more traffic to both of us!

Follow to be updated on Josphat's next check-in. My life is different from how it was before. I now can afford new clothes and put food on my table. This was not the case. I used to sleep on an empty stomach on some days and my clothes were know by many reason being I used to repeat clothes. I currently do not have any additional goals. Although, I am planning to expand my business and even have a kiosk where one can find all the groceries stocked. I spent the most recent transfer to start up a grocery business. Initially, I used to idle and had no source of income. But when I received the transfer, I bought a hand cart and a stock of groceries. So my kiosk is portable and can move while selling. This has kept me busy and also I manage to earn an income on a daily basis. My goal is to create more opportunities for earning income for my family . The biggest difference is that I am currently assembling building materials to put up a barber shop and an electronic shop. This will help me generate income. This means I will no longer have to work as a casual worker. Upon receiving my recent transfer I bought poles, iron sheets, and nails. I am planning to put up a shelter for a barber shop and an electronic shop. This will help me generate income for my family. The remaining amount I bought clothes for my wife and child. The moment I received money from GD I was in disbelief. I was not sure whether GD was serious about sending the money. I knew that my life was going to improve. Reason why I prioritize my plan the way I did, is because it has always been my wish to start my own business and it looks like my dream has come true, therefore I will start investing in new business, which is barber shop business, second priority I will buy clothes for my child and for myself because is the only opportunity to look presented in community, third priority I will continue investing in my business, by boosting it, in terms of introducing other goods such as electronics that would support it in terms of paying rent. My top concern is police violence because, police usually suspect any group of youth sitting together, hence if they found any youths in group, they will start bullying them by searching pockets so as to find something like bang, knife, i mean anything that can leads to a reason for arrest, this usually affect friendship within community, because of fear of being harassed hence many prefer walking alone or staying in doors. Ever since, I wanted to be a hardworking businessman, where I will have multiple of stable businesses that will support me in my daily needs, many people don't likes to depends on others and that's me, meaning that I will be dependent man. During my free time I usually woke up at 7:00am where I will take a bath, brush my teeth, take breakfast, after I will go to our group to do usually activities which is garbage collection, that will take two hours of my time, afterwards I will join my friends in hall and watch football, 1:00pm I will take a break for my lunch,after lunch I will go back to hall to watch latest movies till 9:00pm, where I will go back home and have my supper then go to sleep.

Learn what a File Manager is actually and just how it differs from its desktop equivalent. A File Manager software tool is available in all web hosting Control Panels. As the name suggests, it is used to manage the files in an account and all File Managers support a range of standard functions - browsing, moving, copying and deleting files. Certain Control Panels could provide you with more advanced capabilities also - changing file and folder permissions or creating and unpacking archives. Even though files could be uploaded and downloaded through an FTP client, the File Manager is employed considerably more often, so the simpler to use it is, the easier it'll be for you to control your presence online altogether. The opposite is also true - a File Manager that is tough to use could make it more aggravating and difficult for you to control your site content, particularly if you don't have previous experience. Our shared web hosting accounts are handled through the innovative Hepsia CP, which includes a feature-rich File Manager tool. Even if you have never had a website hosting account before, you'll be able to manage your content with no trouble, as the File Manager is very intuitive to use. It takes only a couple of clicks to create, rename or delete a file, while moving a file or a whole folder is as basic as dragging-and-dropping it to the needed location. You shall be able to upload data in the very same way - simply pick the files on your computer and drag them to your internet browser, then drop them within the File Manager, that shall do the rest. Convenient right-click menus will permit you to pack/unpack archives, to modify file permissions, to set up password-protected areas or to change a file with simple and advanced editors. When you host your Internet sites in a semi-dedicated server account with us, you will be able to use our feature-rich File Manager. The tool is a part of the custom-built Hepsia Control Panel and is just as basic and intuitive to use. It will only take a mouse click to create, rename or delete a file or a folder in your account and for your ease and comfort, you shall be able to sort the content by size, name, type or last modified date. As the File Manager supports drag-and-drop actions, you can speedily relocate any content within the account, including folders, and their structure will be preserved. If you want to upload any content, you'll not need an FTP program, as you could drag-and-drop the folders right from your PC. The File Manager also incorporates more advanced functions and you shall be able to change file permissions, to use archives and to edit files with plain text and HTML editors, that can easily be accessed through right-click context menus.

Few combinations are more poisonous than race and politics. That combination has torn whole nations apart and led to the slaughters of millions in countries around the world. You might think we would have learned a lesson from that and stay away from injecting race into political issues. Yet playing the race card has become an increasingly common response to growing public anger at the policies of the Obama administration and the way those policies have been imposed. When the triumphant Democrats made their widely televised walk up Capitol Hill after passing the health care bill, led by a smirking and strutting Nancy Pelosi, holding her oversized gavel, some of the crowd of citizens expressed their anger. According to some Democrats, these expressions of anger included racial slurs directed at black members of Congress. This is a serious charge– and one deserving of some serious evidence. But, despite all the media recording devices on the scene, not to mention recording devices among the crowd gathered there, nobody can come up with a single recorded sound to back up that incendiary charge. Worse yet, some people have claimed that even doubting the charge suggests that you are a racist. Among the people who are likely to be most disappointed with the Obama administration are those who thought it would usher in a post-racial society. That they wished for such a society is a credit to their values. But that they actually expected a move in that direction suggests that they ignored both Barack Obama’s history and the heavy vested interest that too many people have in race hustling. This is just one of many areas in which this country is likely to pay a very high price for the fact that too many voters paid attention to Obama’s rhetoric while ignoring his actual track record. However soothing the Obama rhetoric, and however lofty his statements about being a uniter rather than a divider– both racially and in terms of bipartisanship– everything in his past fairly shouts the opposite, but only to those who follow facts. Has he been allied with uniters or dividers in the past? Do Jeremiah Wright, Bill Ayers and Father Pfleger sound like uniters? What has his administration done– as distinguished from what the president has said– since taking office? It has dropped the prosecution of black thugs caught on camera stationed outside a polling place intimidating voters. Obama has promoted to the Supreme Court a circuit judge who dismissed a discrimination lawsuit by white firefighters, whose case the Supreme Court later accepted and ruled in their favor. He preceded this appointment by talking about needing people on the court with “empathy.” That is a pretty word but the ugly reality is that it is just another euphemism for bias. For generations, white Southern judges had all kinds of empathy for other white Southerners, which is to say, bias against blacks. The question is whether you want equal treatment or you want payback. Cycles of revenge and counter-revenge have been at the heart of racial and ethnic strife throughout history, in countries around the world. It is a history written in blood. It is history we don’t need to repeat in the United States of America. Political demagoguery and political favoritism have turned groups violently against each other, even in countries where they have lived peacefully side by side for generations. Ceylon was one of those countries in the first half of the 20th century, before the politics of group favoritism so polarized the country– now called Sri Lanka– that it produced a decades-long civil war with mass slaughters and unspeakable atrocities. The world has been shocked by the mass slaughters of the Tutsis by the Hutus in Rwanda but, half a century ago, there had been no such systematic slaughters there. Political demagoguery whipped up ethnic polarization, among people who had co-existed, who spoke the same language and had even intermarried. We know– or should know– what lies at the end of the road of racial polarization. A “race card” is not something to play, because race is a very dangerous political plaything.

You can extend the bake functionality by including var $tasks = array(‘Controller’, ‘Model’); in your Task and then call $this->Model->__bake(..); and $this->Controller->__bake(..) within your task. I did this to make a neat little “scaffold” task that assumes associations with the model and automatically bakes both Model and Controller (plus has support for plugins1). a solution to this would be the script reading a queue of answers, since they are almost the same… and only ask something in case of error.. Another solution would a command to generate Models, for instance, to ALL tables , following the same answers. There are some good ideas here. It would be nice to have some of them submitted as enhancements. The plan is to extend the tasks to do something similar to what Brandon is proposing. Also, I guess I need to change the bake methods in each of the tasks to be public. @Samuel DeVore: Yes, that are some good points. @Xander: In the meantime there is a faster way to bake models, see Faster baking with bake. There’s something missing … because when I try the nice and simple cake bake, I get bash errors.

AI and deep learning is serious business at NVIDIA, but that doesn’t mean you can’t have a ton of fun putting it to work. Researchers at NVIDIA challenge themselves each day to answer the “what ifs” that push deep learning architectures and algorithms to richer practical applications. See some of that work in these fun, intriguing, artful and surprising projects. Step right up and see deep learning inference in action on your very own portraits or landscapes. Our researchers developed state-of-the-art image reconstruction that fills in missing parts of an image with new pixels that are generated from the trained model, independent from what’s missing in the photo. Give it a shot with a landscape or portrait. Erase at will — get rid of that photobomber, or your ex, and then see what happens when new pixels are painted into the holes. Why spend years learning to paint like a cubist when deep learning can do the work in an instant? There’s a clever trick to quickly transferring the style of one photo onto another while keeping the resulting image photorealistic. NVIDIA researchers did it by adding stylization and smoothing steps to the transfer algorithm. Try it out and turn your favorite image into a Van Gogh, go for a cubist turn with Picasso, even see what you’d look like in a police sketch and more with this interactive style transfer algorithm. Virtual worlds filled with scenes, people, and objects represent a real word challenge to generate with speed, resolution, realism, complexity and editability. Playing around with this synthesizer will give you a demonstration of the leading-edge approach our researchers took when it comes to generating faces. They engineered five new features into an existing network that now generates synthetic faces that are basically impossible to tell from “real” world images. Try it out and see if you can tell the difference. Come solve the greatest challenges of our time.
On March 1, the Fairfax County police will begin a pilot program testing the implementation of body-worn cameras on officers in the field. The police shooting of a man suspected of ramming his SUV into another car at a Silver Spring shopping center was captured on the officer’s body-worn camera, police said. The footage has been turned over to the state’s attorney’s office. What will 2017 bring for the D.C. region? Here’s a look at some of the big stories WTOP will be covering in the new year. “They turn them on whenever they have a call for call for service or whenever they’re going to have an interaction with the public,” said Interim D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham. District of Columbia officials on Tuesday released footage from a body-worn camera showing the moments after a motorcyclist was fatally shot by a police officer. “We are planning to go operational in October of this year,” said Carlos Acosta, the inspector general for the Prince George’s County Police Department. “Seeing [an incident] from the very beginning to the very end with a body camera is an a lot more accurate portrayal of what actually happened,” said Montgomery County’s Assistant Police Chief. The number of cameras will grow about fivefold, but an amendment allows officers to see footage before they write their reports. Policies take shape for use of police body cameras in Md.
The benefits of eating raw food are many, some of which are listed in the health tip Unheated Food. But which foods in a store are actually raw? Raw food is normally defined as any food not heated above 118° F. Food that was never heated, such as an apple or celery, is obviously raw. Some food that is warmed up but not heated above 118 degrees would also be considered raw, such as a raw ingredient soup that has not been warmed over 118° F. In a food store, if you can find cold-smoked fish, that means that the smokehouse temperatures were below 100° F and so the fish is still considered raw. But, generally-speaking, unless you are in the produce section buying fruits and vegetables or in the meat and fish section buying fresh fish and meat, very little else in the store is truly raw. “Fresh” juice is also cooked (flash-pasteurized)! Read more about this in the Juice health tip. In the food industry, there are different definitions about what is okay to be labeled “raw”. For example, “raw honey” is not really raw. Read more on that in the health tip on Honey. Even the cheese industry has its own definition of raw. Most cheeses labeled raw are not actually raw, based on the “not heated above 118° F” common definition. Much food is easily made raw on your own without buying packaged, factory-made food. Try the recipes in my Recipes section, to get started on some healthy, quickly-made food! Eating a high percent of raw food is your least expensive health insurance!
Great honeyed fruit character with a succulent minerality, hints of citrus and juicy apples on the palate with a dry almost chalky finish. In 1971 Jean-Marc Brocard married Claudine Petit, daughter of a wine grower in Saint Bris. Jean-Marc learnt the art of winemaking from his father-in-law Emile Petit and Emile’s cousin Louis. Then in 1973 Jean-Marc settled in Préhy in Chablis starting with just 0.3ha of vines. In 1986 he built a cellar amongst the vineyards which dominates the views north towards Chablis itself. Today he is handing reins over to his son Julien, who is ably assisted by his sister Céline. They are now in charge of over 200 ha of vineyards, which they farm on biodynamic and organic principles, with new state-of-the-art technologies being used in the chai - a new gravity fed winery was built in 2001 that uses a quarter of the water of the old one. Meanwhile sales have forged ahead and they currently export to over 44 countries worldwide. Brocard wines are elegant and poised – “precision and freshness” the signature that Julien says he seeks.

The Modify Units & View Army panels have been revamped to improve performance. These pages now automatically save any changes you make to them, you no-longer need to confirm changes to these pages. Also, there is now on-screen feedback for Integrating and Activating units. Lastly, you can now assign a unit to a Task Force from the View Army screen. This allows you to quickly toggle all units in a Task Force in or out of your army depending on your current deployment needs. If you use the Image Pack you can download the new files here. If the Integration chance is failed a destroy check is made for one Tear, if the Tear is not destroyed a new Integration check is made, this process repeats until Integration succeeds or a Tear is destroyed when Integration fails. This process improves the chance of Integration above the percent-chance to integrate listed above. Players without TinyDayz can rejoice, your day has come: Unit and Mod restrictions are lifted. You can now use / build all Units and Mods except for Uniques. This means that Advanced units and Intermediate / Advanced mods are now fair game. This will give players without TinyDays a more complete TinyWarz experience. To balance this, players without TinyDays can no-longer build / deploy bases and are restricted to the following planets - Wulf, Taris, Riona, Esika, Konu. To cut down on the confusion of which planet to deploy to new players will now gradually gain access to planets as they level-up. Initially only Taris and Riona can be used, then Wulf is added at Level 3 and Esika / Konu are added once a player reaches Level 5. At Level 10 all planets are unlocked. 1) It gave too much of an advantage to large factions: Large factions with lots of shared construx had a huge advantage over smaller ones. There should be some advantage to shared construx, but not a massive one. 2) Removed need for dedicated builders: With everyone receiving the bonus for all the construx a faction had everyone in the faction could be a builder lessening this role in the game. 3) Removed need to rely on construx: Again this gets back to the large-faction advantage. Having unlimited shared construx made larger factions more desirable because of their huge library of build-able items any of which could be created risk-free. 4) Killed off Construx trading market: This used to be a very robust in-game market and a great way to make some additional TinyBucks for the savvy trader. Unfortunately, because of the decreasing demand for construx (because a player could just join a faction with lots of shared construx) this market has been hurting for some time. 5) Not in the spirit of TinyWarz: One of the theme's of this game is to *individually* trade and collect construx. Having unlimited shared has pretty-much removed this from the game. The construx you have are, in-a-way an extension of you and what you bring to a faction. A player should be considered valuable for the things he or she can build for a faction, not the other way around. The server will be down for maintenance at 6pm PST to install more RAM. TinyWarz will be offline for 20-40 minutes while this update takes place. Also: Part of the next update will contain improvements to how mod data is organized on the server. This should provide a performance improvement, especially for users & factions with a large number of mods. Unfortunately, this update will remove all mods (except for integrated mods) from units and all mods from the market; this is necessary due to the difference between the old and new mod code. To best prepare for this update, note your mod & unit set-ups now so you can quickly re-build them once this code is added to the server. Crews will not be removed from units when this update is applied. - New Merit has been added, Acti Master - All Actis on the unit gain -1 Cooldown / +1 Charge, Regen +1 Charge every 10 Turns. If you are using the Image Pack you can download the image for this merit here. New tutorials are being added which will help players learn how to play TinyWarz. The first of these guides on how to create and modify your army has already been posted. New players will automatically be directed to the tutorial index when they join the game to make it easier to find help. Faction War planets now support Super Nodes! If one faction is able to capture all of the Nodes on a Faction War planet (Hellion or Infernus), one of these Nodes will be randomly converted into a Super Node. A Super Node pays out Faction Points similiar to a stardard Node except at horizon. At horizon a Super Node will pay out 1,000 Faction Points to the faction which controls the Node at that time. Only one Super Node can be created per planet. A planet's deploy information will display which Node is the Super Node, this information is also broadcast on the planet from time to time. A faction must capture all Nodes on the planet by the 3,000th turn (1,500 turns before horizon) in-order to create a Super Node. Other than the additional faction point pay-out a Super Node has no other special properities and can be captured or re-captured like any other Node. Also, Ore amounts in ore deposits on non-PvP planets has been slightly increased to help starting players gather starting resources faster. Damage reduction Mods for Ballistic, Missile and Energy attacks have been reworked. The reduction amounts on all these Mods has been increased from 20% to 25% and from 40% to 50%, these effects now also stack. Damage reduction is capped at 60% in each weapon category; the additional reduction bonus for building damage has been removed. The Dark Inquisitor (50% Energy) and Phase Guardian (25% all types) Meka have had their damage reduction amounts increased. New players now receive a larger selection of units / mods and starting factions now also have more shared construx to build with. Starting players no-longer receive two Construx packs. If you choose to change your username, your old name will appear as an aka in your user profile. Your new name will automatically appear in any messages, sales, or actions you performed before the change. All user feedback is also retained after you change your name. You can change your name from the Headquarters -> TinyBucks panel for 50 TinyBucks. - The Dark Inquisitor Meka now receives a 40% reduction in Energy weapon damage taken. - Steeltec Repair Droid now repairs 25 Armor per turn (was 20). Faction Leaders with less than 20,000 Faction Points can now purchase 10,000 Faction Points for 100 TinyBucks from Faction -> Admin -> Levels. This is a one-time only purchase, the faction can never be merged with another faction if this purchase is made. If a faction makes this purchase, it must wait until a total of 30,000 Faction Points are earned before purchasing Faction Construx with Faction Points. New Faction Construx are now available! Factions can gain additional construx from the current pool of Faction construx including new rare construx which allow the construction of previously unbuildable meka and vehicles. Faction Leaders can now purchase additional Faction Construx for 3 TinyBucks and 100 Faction Points each. Each construx purchased this way is randomly chosen from the current pool of Faction Construx, including the new Dark Inquistor Meka. With each purchase there is a chance that a rare construx will be created instead. With each purchase a faction has a 16.7% chance of gaining an Advanced Construx, a 33.3% chance of gaining a Intermediate Construx and a 50% chance of gaining a Simple Construx. After the complexity is determined, there is a 20% chance that the construx will be a rare (non-faction) construx. If you are using the Image Pack, you can download the additional files here.
While I am glad to see that house work is becoming more equalized, this article really irritated me. It claimed that one of the reasons men are able to do more house work is because their wives have become less controlling and over bearing. I find this completely ridiculous, and it embraces that negative stereotype of women. I found that while this article is talking about being progressive, the language it used to convey its message was very deeply rooted in gender stereotypes. I completely agree, the way the article was written makes women sound inherently bitchy. I wasn’t happy with the way they described women’s attachment to housework as an identity thing, either. It felt cliched and sexist. In the end, I decided that the overall message of the statistics was happy. Focusing on the facts helped me get through the article, and ignore the way the author butchered gender roles. I didn’t agree with how the article portrayed women either. I tend to be the kind of person who likes things done a certain way but my stepdad is the same way. He is far more overbearing with things like that than my mom has ever been. The author forgets that it doesn’t have a ton to do with gender but the individual person.
Challenge - use up some of my "scraps" Like most, I hate to waste my supplies, so if I cut something out with my Cricut or Cuttlebug, etc. I will use my punches to "use" any left over paper on the sheet (if it's not big enough to save for a tag or something larger). My problem is I now have envelopes of different shapes, etc. I challenged myself to make a card using some of the many pieces I had punched. The card came out surprisingly well - just showing that we can use those "scraps" for something useful! Try it with your little bits and pieces and see what you can come up with! It was a challenge - and a fun one at that! Excellent idea and a wonderful way to use up all those bits that we just can't bear to throw away. I am sure that many a crafter has that box of bits lying in a cupboard somewhere all you need is the imagination to put them all to good use. Comments for Challenge - use up some of my "scraps" Love the way you have used the scraps into making yet another card. I have lots of white scraps in all shapes and sizes, any ideas how to use them?

On Friday March 3, young Bricklaying tradesman Adrian Clark joined the list of young Queensland bricklayers taking on the world – this time, as a recipient of one of just three overseas training scholarships awarded by the Queensland Overseas Foundation (QOF) for 2017. All recipients were eligible to apply, having participated in WorldSkills 2016 competitions. Adrian Clark, who lives in Rocksberg, north of Brisbane, trained with BIGA and works at Legacy Construction, Burpengary. Through their scholarships, these recipients will be given the exciting opportunity to live and work overseas in the country of their choice for up to two years, with initial support funds to help them settle in. The Queensland Overseas Foundation Inc. provides vocational education and training to graduates and professionals with the opportunity to broaden their vocational horizons and improve their career prospects by working overseas. Established in 1976, the Foundation is sponsored by industry and supported by the Queensland Government. Adrian was the first EVER bricklayer to win one of these highly valued scholarships. Congratulations Adrian on behalf of all at ABBTF, nationally. The 2017 QOF Award Ceremony was held at Parliament House in Brisbane and once again we were honoured by the presence of our Patron, His Excellency the Honourable Paul de Jersey AC, Governor of Queensland and Mrs Kaye de Jersey. I was pleased to attend on behalf of ABBTF, Qld and to witness another example of the opportunities that can flow from our trade. Apprenticeships are available now! In Adrian’s own words “Of all the places that I expected bricklaying to take me, Parliament House definitely wasn’t one of them”. Adrian is now off to the UK and Europe where he hopes to learn more about Heritage and Historic brickwork, something he is eager to pursue in his career. The other two scholarship winners were in the vocations of business studies and meat processing (retailing). Adrian was part of the Qld contingency that competed for the 2016 National WorldSkills Australia bricklaying competition in October in Melbourne, shown below. Adrian doesn’t need to go to Europe to learn Heritage brickwork skills. There are plenty of people in WA and SA in particular that he could have trained with!! Perhaps Queensland has a shortage of Heritage builders in brickwork du eto its building types, but not the other states.
At a very young age, Gilda Radner learned how to ward off playground jerks looking to turn her weight into a subject of ridicule. “Comedy is hitting on the truth before the other guy thinks of it,” were words she lived by, and a reliance on self-deprecating humor became a key to her survival. Soon after the opening credits — but not before the audience is given a chance to re-familiarize itself with the subject — a quartet of more contemporary SNL alumnists (Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Bill Hader, and Melissa McCarthy) are called upon to to read select passages from Gilda’s diaries. Fortunately, their participation is kept to a minimum. Most celebrities don’t leave behind a stockpile of research material such as this, and director Lisa D’Apolito puts it to good use. The photographs alone would fill several storage lockers. Add to this an autobiographical audiobook narrated by the author, performance videos, and recently discovered audio tapes, and you’d swear Gilda was an active participant in the project. 2018.

On This Day in 1864 ~ KC Civil War History: Saturday, October 8, 1864. Yesterday was a fine day, and trade lively. The streets were unusually full. Rev. Mr. Harlow returned yesterday. The members of his church and many friends will be glad to see him again. The packet came down yesterday morning, well loaded. Besides freight for our merchants, there was a lot of ordnance stores. The Fifteenth Kansas has left Fort Scott. JEFFERSON CITY, OCT. 6 -- 5:30 P. M. Price has advanced his cavalry and artillery and is pressing in the fighting. My wounded are coming in from the front. There is no question but he is moving in force. What you do should be done quickly. The telegraph and our communications will probably be cut to the west to-night. I have only to say if we do not make a successful defense he will be into Kansas City in a short time with large reinforcements. -E. B. BROWN, Brig. Gen. The enemy are steadily advancing and closing upon us. They crossed the Osage in force at Prince's Ferry at noon to-day. We hold them at the Morean to-night or the road to Castle Rock. Shall contest their advance inch by inch. A few killed and wounded to-day. We hear of no force pressing the enemy's rear. We shall fight them to-morrow, and hope to give you a good report. CLINTON B. FISK, Brigadier General. STARTLING JOKE. -- A waggish son of Esculapius caused great consternation in some of the establishments leveeward yesterday, by the startling announcement that Price was advancing, and was close to the town! They were relieved when he explained that it was Tom Price, who had just come down on the railroad packet. FLAG STAFF RAISING. -- Capt. Edgar Seelye will raise one of the tallest flagstaffs this afternoon at the Fort at two o'clock. All are invited to attend. A new flag will be run up; and, in the language of one of our native poets, "long may it wave." It is almost unnecessary to add that the Captain will see that nothing is wanting to give spirit and enthusiasm to the occasion.
I made some final changes after looking at some things. Lock em' in. I'll play this year. These are all stocks I actually own so I hope this goes well. Edit: Also, big thanks to being willing to do this again! Just curious why Jan 4? The winner will be entitled to one year of free membership to TigerDroppings.com. as long as this site's owners don't charge a fee to be a member of it. I didn't know that this was serious contest with a real valuable prize. I'm in but I have to give this some thought. It’s just 3 trading days into the year and gives any procrastinators recovering from the year end holidays one last chance to join in. We waited too long, imo, this current contest (2018) to stop taking entrants and it resulted in some late picks that were already up big before the deadline came. Would you prefer a different deadline? For everyone who signed up this evening, I’ll add you to my spreadsheet tomorrow morning when I’m back at my computer. I’ll upvote your posts when I add your name so you’ll know you’re in. I’ll post a complete list of everyone participating showing each person’s picks (for you to check for data errors on my part) when we get close to the deadline date. I was the procrastinator this year so I can’t vote against that. Performance should all start on the same day, the following Monday open. In a perfect world, you’re right. The problem is I use MorningStar.com to provide the YTD performance percent which I export into my Excel spreadsheet and that’s what it is.......YTD. I don’t see an option for “January 7 to-date” performance. The only option would be make the deadline January 1, 2019 so YTD performance begins the next day which would be the first trading day of 2019. Big implications here with you giving out free TD memberships. Let’s get it right. The motion to move the deadline for participating in our World Famous Stock Pick 'em Contest to January 1 has been made and seconded. Hearing no objections, the motion carries. January 1 is now the deadline for joining our contest.

Toronto-headquartered Scotiabank's deal to sell its Malaysian subsidiary to Taiwan's Cathay Financial Holding Co Ltd. has been called off. Scotiabank said the deal did not close before a pre-agreed deadline and as a result it will not be moving forward. Scotiabank had reached an agreement to sell its Bank of Nova Scotia Berhad last year for a reported C$225 million. The bank says it is now reviewing its strategic options for its Malaysia franchise.

A glacier walk is both playful and challenging. Our guides, who are also geologists will teach you about the nature of the glacier and the stories around them. Tied to a rope we venture into the blue ice and can either have an easy tour or climb into crevasses. A glacier walk is a metaphor for communication and team spirit, as we have to watch out for each other and communicate what is up ahead and otherwise surrounding us.
In celebration of Sunday's World Cup final, we've put together our picks for the 10 best soccer commercials we've ever seen. Perhaps not surprisingly, the list is dominated by Nike (and Wieden + Kennedy), with Adidas's soccer spots often seeming to fall a bit short. We left off most of the fluffy stuff (like every Pepsi soccer spot ever done) in favor of the meat and potatoes. Check out the list here.
On 23rd March 2016, South West Trains together with the Department for Transport launched a Mock Up of the new Class 707 train at London Waterloo. They also revealed plans to provide extra capacity to services across the network and major station improvements. This will allow existing trains in the South West Trains fleet to be cascaded to strengthen other services on the network. Other stations such as Surbiton and Vauxhall will be improved to increase capacity and passenger flows. This is the biggest package of improvements for passengers travelling to and from Waterloo for decades. It will provide passengers with a better station, extra seats and new trains. As part of our Railway Upgrade Plan, Network Rail is investing £40 billion to provide a bigger, better, more reliable railway for passengers across Britain. The plans announced today will create a bigger, better Waterloo and improve passengers’ journeys on our most congested part of Britain’s railway.

We came from Puerto Rico. - Very good location. Right at the gate of old Quebec.

The Wicomico County Sheriff's Office says two Salisbury men are responsible for the graffiti written in chalk on the county courthouse. The Wicomico County Sheriff's Office has charged two Salisbury men it says are responsible for the graffiti written in chalk on the county courthouse. The sheriff's office has identified 29-year-old Christopher Aulerich and 27-year-old Jordan Swanson, both of Salisbury, as the people responsible for writing the anti-Confederate messages. The messages included phrases like "Finish the Civil War," "Tear Down Winder," "Winder is Scum" and "Lynching Happened Here." The sheriff's office said both men have been charged with malicious destruction of property less than $1,000. When the investigation began Monday, the sheriff's office said deputies observed 28 spots on sidewalks and concrete walls belonging to Wicomico County that had been covered in graffiti written in chalk. It took county employees "numerous hours" to scrub and power wash the property clean, according to officials. While reviewing surveillance video, the sheriff's office said detectives spotted two men, whom they were later able to identify as Aulerich and Swanson, defacing the county property at about 9 p.m. Sunday, Sept. 24. The two were charged Tuesday and released on criminal citation. The chalk messages appear to be related to a recent effort to remove a historical marker commemorating Confederate Gen. John Henry Winder, which is located on the courthouse lawn.

Be Kind is a small, personal, and unique retreat with space for 4 guests. It is important for us to guide you as much as possible during your juice and digital detox. Expect loving Be Kind staff and teachers who will share their energy with you and help you to find the right path in life. We have different teachers who are all unique in their own teaching. You will have the opportunity to learn a lot about your tech use and your spiritual site. The aim is to motivate you to really look inside and work on yourself during the retreat. Of course, we will always be there to guide or support you. Be Kind retreats is about internal attention and not about external attention. Don’t expect big groups or impersonal teachers. We create inspiration group circles where we encourage each other to listen to ourselves and share stories and energy. However, the retreat is focussed on the connection with yourself and not with others. Surrounded by fellow travellers, yogis, and open-minded people you will feel right at home. The location is perfect, in a quite authentic village in the mainland of Canggu. There is arranged free transportation to several hotspots and beaches in the neighbourhood throughout the day (don’t need to worry about riding a motorbike). You will find comfy hangouts around the garden, house, and kitchen. The rooms are big and fully furnished, so you will have your rest and privacy. We are most happy with environmentally thinking persons, who treat the villa with love and share their positive energy. All rooms have been designed to offer you maximum rest and privacy. There are two shared rooms and one private room. The interior is personal and unique which will make you feel right at home. All rooms come with en-suite bathroom, hot shower, air-conditioning, towels, fresh linen, and toiletries. This retreat does not just learn you how to surf, we believe that surfing is a great tool to overcome your fears, to be more confident in your daily life and to change your habits and negative thoughts. The ocean has a positive impact on human health, spending time in the water is a natural healer to let go of stress and heaviness. Surfing will make you more patient; when you are in the water, you have to wait for the perfect wave, you can’t force the perfect wave to arrive. You will surf four times with our experienced, Australian trained and certified surf coach. He will make sure you are safe, have fun and teach you how the ocean works, how to stand up, turn and take your own waves. We have created a workbook with several mindfulness exercises which you can do before and after each surf lesson. In the yoga shala of the villa, you will have one yoga class per day. The afternoon class is a perfect time to reflect on your day and reconnect with yourself. You will practice yoga in a small group where you will feel safe and in perfect balance. We will introduce you to different yoga styles. This is a great opportunity to learn more about each yoga style and to find out which style you most connect with. We offer hatha, yin, kundalini, restorative, guided meditation, yoga nidra and vinyasa. The lessons are suited for every level. If you have never practiced yoga before, our teachers will be there to guide you through every pose and explain you about each yoga style. While letting your muscles work during the surf and yoga sessions, it is important to allow your body to get some extra rest. A daily relaxing massage in a beautiful tropical spa will help your muscles heal and stay flexibel and confident in your own body. While rest is important, we don’t want you to feel bored. After the daily massage you can spend some time relaxing by the pool or walking in the rice paddies in the beautiful tropical spa. Be Kind retreats is about reconnecting with yourself. In order to do that, we believe that it is important to disconnect from social media and anything digital. No Facebook and Instagram, no phones and laptops and no Wi-Fi means less distractions, comparing and judging. It gives you the opportunity to learn how to do nothing, to enjoy being you, to be more mindful and to love yourself more.

A husband finally got the chance to tell his wife she's pregnant. Sam from Sam and Nia, a YouTube channel was able to take a cover test his wife for pregnancy. After realizing Nia's period was two weeks later, Sam took 'a specimen,' as he called it, from the toilet after she forget to flush at night. Once he discovered the truth, he then got to break it to her but not before cracking some jokes first about how she can't drink wine or eat baloney. Nia was absolutely mind-blown and got to share the news immediately with their children who were sitting beside them at the breakfast table. Can you imagine a more perfect moment?

Renting a weekender always brings with it the temptation to guess what the owners are like from clues left on the property. Away at Berry, a sandstone country house in the rustic French style, has more clues than most. There is a strikingly modern CD player with funky column speakers and high fidelity sound (serious music lovers) and a modest library featuring titles by Gough Whitlam and Kenneth Slessor, a history of Balmain and Glebe, and a volume on cricket. Eclectic lefties, we decide, and rich to boot. Whoever you are, thanks very much. After a weary week in town it was bliss to tuck ourselves away at Away and pretend we live like that all the time. Set on a large block bordered by Brogers Creek and ringed by national park and state forest, the property is luxurious. The view towards Ulrich’s Pass and Budderoo National Park is captivating, while indulgent accommodation awaits indoors. As well as four comfortable bedrooms there are two bathrooms a claw foot bath in each plus extra loo, a laundry, a combined and capacious living area comprising a gourmand’s kitchen, a dining area and lounge with cathedral ceiling, and generous deck with outdoor dining setting and barbecue. Attractive landscaping features an elevated lawn, a pond packed with bulrushes and frogs, a rose garden, citrus grove and plantings of fuchsias and gardenias. Rainbow lorikeets, blue wrens, kookaburras and giant skinks share the surrounds with you. There’s not much walking to do nearby unless you’re a fan of very steep country roads. Better to drive 10 minutes or so to Seven Mile Beach and the national park there, or visit Kangaro Valley just down the mountain. Berry is less than 10 minutes drive (Sydney’s about two hours, give or take a traffic jam) and seems to have even more cafes and antiquey boutiques than last time we visited. Getting a park near the main street at Saturday lunchtime requires as much optimism as ever but the town is still a worthy diversion. Have a beer at the kooky Great Southern Hotel (the one with the wall display of hub caps), scout out second hand book bargains, or pick up some gourmet heat and serve meals from Delicious Food by Lisa! The weather remained mostly moody and atmospheric, as it tends to in the mountains, but the sun came out one afternoon and we took advantage of it by lying on the rear lawn and staring skywards. Simple pleasures, true, but the memory still makes me smile.
A Japanese investigative website (http://blog.m3.com/Retraction/) has found 12 published articles where manipulation of images is very likely. The suspicious images in the papers published by the Matsubara lab are carefully deconstructed by Abnormal Science in an ongoing series of posts: here, here and here. The “public manner” was three posts last year on the Abnormal Science blog… alleging that images were manipulated in the manuscripts, and that histology slides were reused. Joerg Zwirner has been following this for some time at his AbnormalScience blog. Retraction Watch also posted about this. But it has now reached the ORI and even the main-stream media. Yet another case of a Person of Indian Origin (PIO), Dr. Bharat B Aggarwal of the MD Anderson Cancer Center, being suspected of massive scientific misconduct this time at the University of Texas. Apparently 65 papers are being reviewed for the manipulation of images. A prominent Indian-American researcher at (the) University of Texas is under scanner for alleged falsification and fabrication in various publications regarding cancer fighting properties of plants. The saga of potential misconduct at the National University of Singapore continues to escalate with further questionable papers regularly being identified by “whistleblowers” to Abnormal Science (Joerg Zwirner). But the investigations initiated by the University are not totally above criticism especially as Prof. Barry Haliwell the Vice President at the University and responsible for these investigations is himself facing allegations of self-plagiarism and is a co-author on some of the questionable papers. There is an urgent need for some outside participation in the investigations to ensure independence and impartiality. My current perception is that the objective of the investigation will over-ridingly be to save the reputation of the University (any by extension of the government of Singapore) and that the investigation committee will be heavily blinkered. Since the government has effectively been trying to short-cut its way to a scientific reputation by “buying in” researchers, there is little chance that the investigations – as they are set up now – will not be contaminated by government meddling. A more stringent management of quality and integrity issues in experimental (medical ) research needs to take center stage at NUS. Vice president Prof. Halliwell is in charge of the Office of Research and Technology at NUS, and therefore responsible for driving the University’s research agenda. Unfortunately, he also appears to handle issues related to science integrity at NUS himself. This constellation constitutes an inacceptable accumulation of responsibilities and should be banned since it carries the potential for conflict of interest. Prof. Halliwell, you might want to take a leave of absence from your position as vice president until these issues (including the allegation of self-plagiarism) have been resolved. Update: 31st October 2011: Further dodgy papers are given in the next instalment from Abnormal Science. Japanese Retraction Watch has also been on the case. Abnormal Science ( Joerg Zwirner) has 3 more examples of papers with some questionable images. This time the papers are from the Department of Physiology, National University of Singapore with 2 papers published in Blood and one in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. 1. Pervaiz S, Seyed MA, Hirpara JL, Clément MV, Loh KW. Purified photoproducts of merocyanine 540 trigger cytochrome C release and caspase 8-dependent apoptosis in human leukemia and melanoma cells. 2. Hirpara JL, Seyed MA, Loh KW, Dong H, Kini RM, Pervaiz S. Induction of mitochondrial permeability transition and cytochrome C release in the absence of caspase activation is insufficient for effective apoptosis in human leukemia cells. Department of Physiology, National University of Singapore, Singapore. 3. Hirpara JL, Clément MV, Pervaiz S. Intracellular acidification triggered by mitochondrial-derived hydrogen peroxide is an effector mechanism for drug-induced apoptosis in tumor cells. J Biol Chem. 2001 Jan 5;276(1):514-21. The two names common to all 3 papers are JL Hirpara and research supervisor Professor Shazib Pervaiz. The NUS investigation committee has its work cut out with all the questionable papers they need to check out (See here and here). Their inquiry commissions might soon run out of unbiased members. NUS should consider to accept assistance from abroad to clean up the mess. And it seems to be truly a mess covering a number of departments which indicates a prevailing culture and not just some isolated incident of wrongdoing. Skeletons seem to be tumbling out of the Singapore academic closet thick and fast as one allegation follows hot on the heels of the last. Previous revelations are here, and here. 1. Abnormal Science reports that another whistleblower has appeared and has pointed out image irregularities (image manipulations?) in two more publications, both from the Department of Pharmacology, National University of Singapore. Abnormal Science. 2. From the Straits Times (h/t as pointed out by an Abnormal Science reader) it is reported that a famous cancer scientist in Singapore is having his work challenged. If Prof. Yoshiaki Ito’s work is found to be flawed then some 200 other publications based on his results would be thrown into doubt. Singapore was recently rocked by the Melendez affair where a much vaunted scientist was found to have manipulated data and 70 of his scientific papers are now under investigation. An excellent summary of the situation is here at Retraction Watch. Alirio Melendez who is currently employed by the University of Liverpool has been suspended pending the results of the investigation. In the strait-laced Singapore society which is utterly convinced about its own excellence in all things, this has come as a rude shock and shattered the complacent view of the academic world that “misconduct does not happen here”. There is now some concern that the reputation of the academic world in Singapore may be seriously tarnished. But the misconduct may be rather more widespread than they would like to think. The “rotten” core was revealed by an “anonymous whistleblower” but it may be just the opening of the lid of a Pandora’s box. Joerg Zwirner, an immunologist and associate professor at Georg-August-Universität Göttingen reports further cases of misconduct at Abnormal Science. He reports – courtesy of the whistleblower again – on 3 further papers where image manipulation is apparent. This time the common author is Kong-Peng Lam, of the Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Immunology, Biomedical Sciences Institutes, Singapore Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR). 1.

This has indeed been an extremely busy week. On Tuesday 25th Nov I was part of a contingent from North Norfolk which met with Lord Smith of Finsbury, the recently appointed Chairman of the Environment Agency (EA), along with the recently appointed Chief Executive Paul Leinster and senior staff. The meeting was requested and organised by Norman Lamb M.P. our local Member of Parliament. I was also pleased to see Tony Wright M.P. (Great Yarmouth) present. It was very heartening to hear Lord Smith acknowledge the extreme problems for individuals and communities faced with a change of current coast protection policy and it’s application. Good to hear from him that he believes the EA must pursue the matter of compensation for those affected , something CCAG has been calling for over many years. Along with this Lord Smith expressed a strong desire to switch the perception that the EA is undertaking a broad policy of abandonment of defences in many areas to one of trying to hold the line where possible. From London I went to Reading where, on Wednesday, I took part in a DEFRA workshop on adaptation measures. This was one of a number I have attended and very much put the peoples view. These events are attended by representatives from a wide spectrum of government departments. We shall have to wait and see what form government’s adaptation package will take, however I can certainly say that all departments are now aware of the problems and hardship faced by individuals and communities on the coast which the present coastal policy is causing. From Reading I went directly to Holland for a series of fact finding meetings with relevant government departments and experts responsible for Dutch coast protection and water management. The trip was organised by Coastnet (www.coastnet.org.uk ) who act as secretariat on behalf of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Coastal and Marine issues. The British contingent was Norman Lamb MP, North Norfolk (Chairman APPG), Graham Stuart MP, Beverley and Holderness (Vice Chairman APPG), Dr Theresa Reading (Coastnet) and myself (CCAG, external member APPG). The day started at the Ministerie van Verkeer en Waterstaat with an excellent presentation from their team and much discussion with many questions from us. We then moved on to Delft with presentations from senior engineers and coastal specialists at Deltares NL, a consultancy of world wide renown situated almost within the campus of Delft University. Again excellent presentations and many questions from us over a very welcome lunch. Next stop was the Headquarters of Provincie Zuid Holland one of the major provincial government centres with a population of approximately 7 million people and responsibility for a major section of the coast. Yet again an excellent presentation and many questions. From there to the Dutch Parliament where we met with a Member of Parliament, this of course was of particular interest to our two MPs. That concluded the day from which I arrived back in North Norfolk in the very early hours of Friday morning. My overall impression is that the Dutch have a much more positive approach to living with the sea and coast protection than exists within the UK. Perhaps this was best demonstrated in the reply to being asked “What will you do about a possible one metre rise in sea levels post 2050?” The response was both calm and assured “We will deal with it.” And one is left in no doubt they will, with consummate success, rather than the throw the towel in and retreat now approach which seems to pervade and typify the UK response to the same problem. The Dutch pay full compensation to homeowners etc when sacrifices have to be made in the wider National interest. Indeed I was most surprised having asked the question “In which legal framework is your policy of paying full compensation rooted, is it Dutch Law or European Law?” We were told “In Holland it is unthinkable to not pay compensation so there is no need for a legal framework, it is automatic“. Little wonder then that they are world leaders in coast protection with an investment of some 1.6 billion euros this year alone they are able to manage their coast in a socially just and extremely effective manner. Along with this their standard of defences is so much higher, for example: Relatively thinly populated rural areas have a one in 1250 year event standard. In this country not even London gets that level of protection at one in 1000 year event standard. The major centres of population in Holland continue to enjoy protection to a one in 10,000 year event standard which they are giving very serious thoughts to increasing ten fold. In offshore dredging, which they do allow, they have only one strictly enforced rule: NO dredging in any area with a depth of twenty metres or less. Much more information was forthcoming on the day, however I can do no better than quote Norman Lamb MP “There is a compelling logic to applying the Dutch approach to the UK“. Finally my thanks go to the APPG and Coastnet for making this excellent fact finding trip possible with special thanks to all our Dutch hosts and their teams for such a warm and courteous welcome. All presentations and discussions were conducted in English not Dutch, very humbling and much appreciated. Next PostNext December 2008 Comments – Taxpayers … value for money?
It was a beautiful Sunday morning. The roads were calm and empty owing to the rain that morning and the persistent drizzle. We were waiting to meet someone special. Can you come over? Here is the address… said Sanjjanaa and off we went. Once we reached her place, she answered the door herself and played a perfect host as she offered us a warm cup of tea, almonds and walnuts. Sanjjanaa Archana Galrani is just a young girl who happens to be a celebrity. A very down-to-earth girl-next-door with a disarming smile and warm face, I loved her no nonsense style of approach to things. Though she was tired to the core and had a bad cough troubling her, she didn’t let it show as she answered our questions patiently and posed as we went on clicking. She is one of the most focused people I have met and is a joy to talk to. Here is what happened when the heartthrob of South Indian film industry talked to Tiger. Hello Sanjjanaa. Welcome to Talk To Tiger. Can we start? Hi Tiger. Thank you for the interview. Looking forward to having fun. Hello everyone. I am Sanjjanaa. I am from our very own Bengaluru. I was in modelling and it eventually moved on to acting and I am deeply blessed. How does one become an actor? Is it easy being an actor? No. It is not easy. It is a lot of hard work, many sacrifices, hours of dedication… it is endless hard work, hard work and hard work. For me, many times, I end up with three events a day, sleep for 4-5 hours and have shooting again in the morning at 5 AM. But it is a lot of fun. I am super happy doing what I love. I have played some interesting characters during my career. I love Shahrukh and would love to act with him one day.Any advice for upcoming actors? Have a backup option and be dedicated to your work. This is a very competitive area and you must always have a backup. Don’t give up easily. If you don’t succeed, it is not the end of the world. You must be good at your back up too. Pursue what you love. I am not very particular. I wear anything I am comfortable in. I do love getting dressed up too. I swear by a couple of designers and showrooms in Bangalore and Hyderabad. How do you get ready? Any colors you like? I do my own make up. I am trained in makeup in Los Angeles from one of the best in the field. So I get ready on my own. I experiment sometimes but it is very simple. I love stronger shades. I drink a lot of water. I put on some good music and just dance and work out for about 30 mins a day. I keep a tab on what I eat. I add more juices, less carbs and keep it simple. The secret is being happy. I never miss my meals. I love snacking on coconut water. There is nothing in particular. Gold, Saturn blue, Royal blue, depends on my mood. I love classic colors and bling. Black is my favorite. I think I don’t have lot of ‘fears’. I do get nervous when my film opens on a Friday and constantly keep checking for reviews. I see myself being a mother and a business entrepreneur. I follow business very closely and have plans for my investments. I want to be an entrepreneur for sure. Do you love reading? You are doing many films now. How do you remember scripts? I read occasional fiction, especially short stories. I love listening. I have a good memory and remember my scripts easily. I rarely have free time. Whenever I get some free time, I love giving back to community. I work with some NGOs and organizations like CRY and believe in sharing what I have. I took the rice bucket challenge recently and encouraged all my fans to do so. I feel really happy when I get a chance to do something for others, especially for those who can’t help themselves. Never give up! I believe in it so deeply that I have a tattoo of it on my wrist. Whatever you do, never give up. Just keep following your passion. Another advice is to donate some money, however small, everyday to someone. Do it for 30 days for me and do it through the year. See how good you will feel when you help others. I love you all and thank you for your love. You can follow Sanjjanaa on Twitter here and facebook here. She is an awesome beauty and seems more better individual.

Then he gave him a piece of silver that was as big as his head. Hans took out his pocket-handkerchief, put the piece of silver into it, threw it over his shoulder, and jogged off homewards. As he went lazily on, dragging one foot after another, a man came in sight, trotting along gaily on a capital horse. said Hans aloud, ‘what a fine thing it is to ride on horseback ! The horseman got off, took the silver, helped Hans up, gave him the bridle into his hand, and said, ‘When you want to go very fast, you must smack your lips loud, and cry "Jip." Hans was delighted as he sat on the horse, and rode merrily on. After a time he thought he should like to go a little faster, so he smacked his lips, and cried ‘Jip’. and his horse would have run off, if a shepherd who was coming by, driving a cow, had not stopt it. Hans soon came to himself, and got upon his legs again. He was sadly vexed, and said to the shepherd, ‘This riding is no joke when a man gets on a beast like this, that stumbles and flings him off as if he would break his neck. one can walk along at one’s leisure behind her, and have milk, butter, and cheese, every day into the bargain. The shepherd jumped upon the horse, and away he rode. Hans drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky one. and the heat grew greater as noon came on, till at last he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more than an hour to cross, and he began to be so hot and parched that his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth. but not a drop was to be had. While he was trying his luck and managing the matter very clumsily, the uneasy beast gave him a kick on the head that knocked him down, and there he lay a long while senseless. Luckily a butcher soon came by driving a pig in a wheel-barrow. said the butcher as he helped him up. said Hans, ‘who would have thought it? If I kill her, what will she be good for? I hate cow-beef, it is not tender enough for me. said Hans as he gave the butcher the cow, and took the pig off the wheel-barrow, and drove it off, holding it by the string that was tied to its leg. but he was now well repaid for all. The next person he met was a countryman carrying a fine white goose under his arm. and Hans told him all his luck, and how he had made so many good bargains. ’Feel,’ said he, ‘how heavy it is, and yet it is only eight weeks old. Meantime the countryman began to look grave, and shook his head. in the village I just come from, the squire has had a pig stolen out of his stye. Poor Hans was sadly frightened. while Hans went on the way homewards free from care. I will put them into my pillow, and then I am sure I shall sleep soundly without rocking. Who so blithe, so merry as I? the rest will come of itself. what could I want more? he was hungry too, for he had given away his last penny in his joy at getting the cow. but as he stooped down to drink, he forgot it, pushed it a little, and down it went plump into the pond For a while he watched it sinking in the deep clear water, then sprang up for joy, and again fell upon his knees, and thanked heaven with tears in his eyes for its kindness in taking away his only plague, the ugly heavy stone. ‘no mortal was ever so lucky as I am’ Then up he got with a light and merry heart and walked on free from all his troubles, till he reached his mother’s house.
The marital home of Tricia Helfer, the actress of “Lucifer” and “Battlestar Galactica” fame, and attorney Jonathan Marshall has sold for $5.4 million. Set on a roomy half-acre in the Beverly Hills Post Office area, the contemporary-style house has about 5,500 square feet of interior space, high ceilings and walls of windows that bring in the views. A step-up dining room, a living room with a wet bar and an office are among the common rooms. Chrome tile work creates visual interest in the kitchen, which has a center island. The master suite — one of five bedrooms and 6.5 bathrooms — has a fireplace and a separate sitting room. Outside, a conversation pit and sports bar create space for entertaining. The fenced and terraced grounds also hold a swimming pool and spa, an outdoor shower and a bocce ball court. The home, built in 1984, originally hit the market in March for $6.195 million. More recently, it had been listed for $5.495 million, according to the Multiple Listing Service. Ari Afshar and Samantha Nugent of Compass were the listing agents. Kathryn Shafer of Keller Williams Realty represented the buyer. She and her husband bought the home seven years ago for $2.9 million, records show. The couple are currently in the process of divorcing.
1. Mother’s Day was almost a week ago, and I sort of completely forgot to mention anything about it. But it was lovely. We went to Charlotte to hang out with my sister, and had a great time. We took Catie to a Children’s Museum on Saturday, which was a lot of fun, then went out for a fantastic dinner. And my sister, who is awesome, got me roses for Mother’s Day. It would’ve been nice if I’d remembered to take them with me when we left her apartment, but I forgot them at her place. Oh well. They were lovely. On Sunday, we went out for brunch, then walked around downtown Charlotte for a while. 2. My stupid elbow still hurts from where I fell on it, and the scab on it is absolutely revolting, but I’m still working out almost every day. I’m just being careful not to do things (like certain yoga poses) that involve putting pressure on my elbow. I’ll be fine. It’s really the food part of the whole diet/exercise thing that I need to work on. I’m still trying to figure out the best way to tackle that. I have a lot of ideas and I’m still trying to sort them out. I’ll write more about it when I figure out what the heck I’m doing. 3. Catie is in this phase where she goes back and forth between being absolutely fun and delightful and amazing and wonderful, and a 37-inch tall hellbeast demon. And you never know which kid you’re going to get at any point in the day. I don’t really know what to do about that, other than just ride out the bad moments, implement discipline when necessary, and try not to lose my temper (that last part is the hardest one). It’s just difficult when she’ll go for like a week without needing to be put in time out at all, then all of a sudden we’ll have to do four time-outs in a single day. Which may be average for a toddler at this phase, but it feels like a lot to me. But, you know, then she’ll say something that’ll have Dave and me doubled over laughing, because she’s an absolute riot. So I guess we’ll keep her, in spite of the occasional tantrums. 4. I had a little moment of panic there on Monday, when Teenie wouldn’t stop barfing. Everything she ate came right back up (and this was after she coughed up a big hairball). I called the vet’s office, they said to bring her in immediately. They gave her a shot of some anti-nausea meds and an injection of fluids under her skin so she wouldn’t get dehydrated, and they ran some bloodwork. She’s borderline hyperthyroid (she’s also dropped over 4 pounds since we left Washington in 2008, which seems like a lot for a small cat – she went from 14 pounds to 9.8), so we’ll keep an eye on that and address it as necessary. The whole thing was pretty upsetting and scary, and it reminded me of this post I wrote a while back, and oh god, if something is really wrong with the cat, how on earth am I going to explain it to Catie? I had a pretty big freak-out about that. But it seems that Teenie is ok. She stopped barfing, so either the meds worked or she got it out of her system. And her bloodwork is otherwise normal. So I’m thankful that I get to postpone that particular horrible (and yes, inevitable, I realize) conversation for a while. Of course, if the damn cat doesn’t stop pooping in random corners of our living room, she may not be long for this world anyway. Argh. 5. Dave and I are celebrating our fifth anniversary on Saturday. Five years. I can’t even wrap my head around that. It’s not that much time in the grand scheme of things, is it? It’s almost like, “Really? That’s it? Only five years?” Because in a lot of ways, it feels like we’ve been together forever. (In a good way. I promise.) So, I’m a little early, but happy anniversary, babe. Love you. P.S. Apparently this is the “wood” anniversary. I swear I’m not making that up. And yes, I giggled when I read that, because I’m a 12 year-old boy.

We are one week into 2018. Do you know where your business plan is? A traditional plan may be just too daunting for most Amazon and online sellers. And let’s face it – a lot of business plan formats are just …. long. They are lengthy, detailed, and full of information that’s not necessary unless you are applying for a business loan or trying to entice a suitor. Don’t worry, it won’t take long. Just a few bullet points on a page can give you new focus for success this year. But here’s the most important part. Make an appointment with yourself for the first day of the month, every month for the rest of the year. Write it in your appointment book or set an alarm on your phone today! That way, you’ll review those goals and make sure you stay on track.
Pioneer Belts made by General Leathercraft Mfg. are some of the highest quality weightlifting belts on the market. The Pioneer Cut Powerlifting Belt is a unique spin on a traditional single prong power belt that allows for 1/2″ size increments instead of the standard 1″. Combine this innovative feature along with some of the highest-quality materials available and a seemingly infinite amount of customization options and you have one of the best power belts available. Pioneer Belts are some of the most popular weightlifting belts currently available. Not only have they been noticed by the public (see their 100K+ Instagram followers for reference) but they've also been noticed by other companies as shown by their latest collaboration with Rogue Fitness. The Pioneer Cut Power Belt is a unique take on the ever-popular single-prong power belt that was invented by powerlifter Steve Strohm that allows for twice as many size adjustments as a traditional belt. Pioneer has combined this technology with heirloom quality materials to create what is likely to be the last belt you'd ever have to buy (we'd understand if you buy many others simply because you like them.) We are big fans of the belt and honestly see it as one of the best value belts available thanks to its quality, price, and potential durability. We recommend the Pioneer Cut Belt to anyone seeking a high-quality power belt. How Does the Pioneer Cut Power Belt Compare to the Competition? What a good powerlifting belt is designed to do is allow the lifter to increase the quality of the isometric muscular contraction in the trunk region. The belt gives the muscles of the trunk something to contract against, providing much-needed proximal support to the spine. The feeling of having a more rigid torso also provides confidence in moving what needs to move, and keeping still what needs to keep still during the lift. The Pioneer Cut Power Lifting Belt that we got sent in is 13mm thick (there thickest option and ordered mostly to compare to the SBD Belt,) and 4” wide which is the standard power belt width (we use 3” and thinner for deadlifts, however.) One of the standout features of Pioneer Fitness (and also one that can be overwhelming) is that they allow you to customize just about every part of your belt. This means that if you know exactly what you want, it’s a breeze. However, if you’re unsure or have a difficult time making decisions, you may be stuck in a constant feeling of unsurety and never actually end up purchasing a belt. One thing that is easy and should be done by everyone who is going to order a belt is to make sure you get the correct size. In order to get the proper size belt, I took out a tape measure and measured my circumference around the navel for the most accurate measurement and then choose my size based upon that. Do not, I repeat, do not just order a belt based upon what you would guess. I’ve done this in the past with power belts and been way off and had to completely reorder a new belt. The 2nd customizing option is for them to use either treated or untreated leather for your Pioneer Cut Powerlifting Belt. The differences between treated and untreated leather are pretty simple. Untreated leather is just raw leather. It can be a little harder to break-in and doesn’t protect as well against moisture. This isn’t a problem for some lifters as they wouldn’t have a problem with their own sweat adding to the character of the belt. The treated leather option means that the belt is immersed in a combination of mineral and fish oils. This allows the leather to be a little more pliable and also helps protect the leather from moisture. The third option you are able to choose from is whether you would like the belt width to be 3” or 4”. More and more companies are beginning to offer belts other than the traditional 4” power belt, and for good reason. Several years ago Mark Rippetoe (author of the barbell textbook Starting Strength) came out with an article called “The Belt and the Deadlift,” where he spotlights the importance of having powerbelt options less than the standard 4” width. Belts less than 4” (such as the Pioneer Cut 3” Power Belt) work much better for most people when performing the barbell deadlift. From here, you have additional customization options that cost a little more money. For instance, you can choose the stitching color within a vast palette of options (add-on $9.95 for any color you choose besides white which comes free). You can also upgrade the buckle color from the standard silver/nickel-plated to black for an add-on of $9.95. Furthermore, you may wish to add custom laser burned messages to your Pioneer Cut Powerlifting Belt to either the outside of the belt (add $50.00), the loop of the belt (add $15.00), or on the tongue of the belt (add $15.00). These messages are standard text, but in our opinion, the lettering comes out very sharp and professional looking. For an additional add-on of $75.00, you may also wish to add a laser burned picture to go onto your belt. The Pioneer Cut Power Belt by Pioneer Fitness (a division of General Leathercraft Manufacturing) is the latest advancement in the prong style of power belts. The first thing we noticed about the Pioneer Power Belt is the reason why it is trademarked. The Pioneer Cut is trademarked as it utilizes a specific design so that you can make precise ½” increments to tighten the belt. Most prong belts adjust only in 1” increments, which often feels either too much or too little. The Pioneer Cut is stated to be a patent pending design by powerlifter Steve Strohm who we’ve talked to via Instagram. It’s nice having a belt designed by someone who has actually spent some time underneath a barbell, as they will perhaps have a better concept of realizing the nuances of what makes a good power belt indeed good. There’s no doubt that the person who came up with the idea actually used it. Tracing our fingers over the lettering we had done to our Pioneer Cut Belt, we noticed how durable and thick the 13mm treated leather feels. The cut and stitching are very uniform and well done. The belt utilizes a seamless roller buckle with a single prong, with nickel-plated rivets to hold the buck system together. One cool feature we noticed is that leather at the buckle end is nicely tapered down so it's not overly thick at the loop. We examined other power belts and noticed that other companies do not taper down the leather nearly as well as Pioneer has. The leather Pioneer uses one solid piece of what is called sole bend leather, sandwiched by two pieces of suede with all three layers being glued and sewn together. Sole bend leather is some of the best quality of leather you can find. Sole leather is cut from the best portion of steer hides (below the shoulder and along the back ends and side of the steer’s spine) and is firm, thick, and strong. Outside of some high-end weightlifting belts, sole bend leather can commonly be found in high-quality shoes and boots. The buckle portion of the belt uses a seamless roller buckle, which is something found on more expensive belts and should increase the longevity of the belt. The prong portion of the buckle is run through the folded portion of the belt, but unlike most power belts, there is a large cutout which allows the prong to slide up or down. This, combined with the offset holes is what allows the belt to adjust in smaller increments, and more importantly, do so without the belt feeling any different from a typical prong belt. To top it off, the Pioneer Cut Powerlifting Belt also comes with a lifetime warranty and is made entirely here in the U.S.A at their shop in Texas. They also offer a discount for military and first responders if you ask them for one. Breaking a belt like this in does take some time. One way to speed this process up is by rolling it up into a circle one way, massaging it back and forth, and then rolling it up into a circle the other way and repeating. This is not a one-time process and will need to be repeated multiple times in the beginning, but eventually, the belt will fit your torso like your favorite baseball glove would your hand. When we take stock of the other powerlifting belts we have used, we notice the little differences that the Pioneer Cut Power Belt have above their competition. The ability to adjust a single prong power belt with ½” increments is a big deal to us. Sometimes a lifter will notice how much their midsection may fluctuate throughout the
Kaon Interactive, the leading provider of 3D marketing and sales applications for global B2B brands, today announced that it is continuing to innovate new technologies and applications for AR (augmented reality) in the enterprise, with its release of 3D AR Scenes. Over the last year, Kaon has elevated the AR business use case from placing photo-realistic, interactive 3D Product Models ‘at scale’ within a real physical space, to now placing interactive 3D scenes (laboratory, data center, office, manufacturing plant, etc.) within a real physical space, in augmented reality. Interacting with 3D scenes in augmented reality are more compelling engagements for customers and prospects because they can take it off their ‘screen’ and put it into their actual environment. B2B companies have struggled with how to make buying engagements more memorable and compelling. Now, Kaon’s 3D AR Scenes gives customers the ability to walk around their environment, envision how a solution works to solve their business or technical challenges, and amplify the customers’ receptiveness to their differentiated value proposition. With the release of iOS 11 and the launch of Apple’s ARkit (and soon Google’s ARCore), Kaon Interactive is driving AR adoption in the B2B space, with 50+ live enterprise AR applications in use, by hundreds of thousands of customers, sales teams and channel partners globally.

On April 2, 2019, Queen Elizabeth II hosted a reception at Windsor Castle in celebration of the centenary of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO). The Princess Royal, The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester also attended the reception at the Castle. NCVO represents a diverse community of over 14,000 member organisations of all sizes – a third of the voluntary sector workforce in England. The Queen met volunteers including Louise Munro who is Helpforce’s Young Volunteer of the Year. Was lucky enough to see the exhibition of Princess Eugenie's wedding dress in Windsor castle and though Her Majesty was at home, we never met 🙁 I like Princess Anne's jacket here and it's always good to see the Duchess of Gloucester at royal events. Amazing. She is just lovely. The duchess of Gloucester is a beautiful woman with amazing jewellery. The queen is rocking her brooch and this blue colour. Dit is eens wat anders dan al die broeken die hier te pas en te onpas verschijnen! Is it allowed to criticize the queen’s fashion? The color of the suit is, of course lovely and becoming. However, the fabric seems very heavy on her small frame and the bulkiness of the collar and shoulders accentuates the thickness of the fabric. Her head is bowed as is natural for a person of her age and the collar draws attention to that rather than lying flat as a softer fabric would. Might I also add that lighter colored gloves might look better than the black ones? I completely agree, Hero. The lovely shade of blue is the only element here that flatters Her Majesty. Yes, I don't see why she should be saved from some "less positive" comments. Very often I have a problem with the colours she chooses, this one is ok for me. Her lipstick is lovely, gorgeous colour! Nice turnout from members of the RF. The Q is always lovely.

Tullamore's Gráinne Walsh will be in action this Saturday night as she bids to retain her National Elite boxing title in the 69kg (welterweight) division. The Liffey Crane National Elite Championships are taking place in Dublin's National Stadium. All of the bouts will be screened live on YouTube and Gráinne's contest is also expected to be shown live on TG4, which is broadcasting the finals from 8.45pm until 11pm. Representing the Spartacus club, Gráinne will be facing a tough opponent, the former European Elite bronze medalist Christina Desmond from Cork club Fr Horgans. Injury ruled Desmond out of last year's national championships, where Gráinne defeated Ciara Ginty in the welterweight final. She she also picked up the 'Jimmy Magee Best Female Boxer' award for her performance on the night.
The ‘Polskiej Szkoły im św Stanisława Kostki’, or Polish School of St Stanisława Kostki, was established in October 2007 by Fr Piotr Zieliński, Arleta Jasinska and Joanna Schmitz at St Peter’s Church in Aberdeen. A parliamentary motion lodged by MSP Lewis Macdonald congratulated and praised the Polish school’s work. It reads: “The Parliament congratulates the Polish School St Stanislaw Kostka in Aberdeen on its 10th anniversary; recognises that more than 300 children and young people attend the Saturday school and are supported by almost 80 volunteers and staff; acknowledges that the school is a vibrant part of the community and supports the young people by helping them becoming bilingual not only through language, history and culture classes, but also through other activities such as its youth club, a choir, theatre and football team, and looks forward to many more years of Polish language education, cultural and sporting activities in Aberdeen. The motion was supported by Kenneth Gibson, Ivan McKee, Edward Mountain, Stewart Stevenson, Claire Baker, Ash Denham and Bill Kidd. The school hosted a show on October 7 for all children, and the consul general of the Republic of Poland in Edinburgh paid a visit to both Aberdeen Grammar School and Harlaw Academy, where the school is based. A show was then put on for guests, the consul general and parents, before a reception at Aberdeen Grammar School. The following day, all joined in celebrating a thanksgiving Mass led by Fr Janusz Wilczynski, the Polish chaplain in Aberdeen. The school’s main objective is to teach Polish language, tradition and history, but it also provides religious education. Working closely with the Church, the school has received particular support from Bishop Hugh Gilbert of Aberdeen. The school not only helps children prepare for the Sacraments, but also assists the Polish chaplain in arranging Mass for the children, which includes a children’s choir. The group also prepares the Sunday issue of the parish newsletter. The Polish School received support at its beginning from Fr Keith Herrera, who allowed the church to be used for classes. As demand grew and numbers leapt from 30 to more than 130 children, the school moved to St Mary’s Cathedral, where it stayed for a year with 150 pupils. It then moved to Aberdeen Grammar School where it still runs classes, with some split to Harlaw Academy, as 300 pupils attend each week. Today, more than 70 staff serve over 500 Polish people at the school, the biggest Polish Saturday school in Scotland. As well as catechesis and Polish language and culture classes, there is a show for Independence Day, a Nativity play, St Nicolas Day celebrations, a Constitution Day show, an end of year ball, an All Saints ball, reading competitions and exhibitions. The school hosts charity events, an SFA-registered football club, courses for parents, adult language classes, speech therapy, a choir, a theatre class, and talks from historians, artists and musicians. What are the Christian democrats proposing for Scotland?

Become A Part of Tour120! Preservation Kentucky’s Tour120 is an exciting new statewide heritage tourism program designed to raise awareness of the importance of historic preservation to Kentucky’s communities, and raise funds to help the nonprofits that preserve, manage and showcase them. The program launches on Saturday-Sunday, May 18-19, 2019, during National Historic Preservation Month, with tours of historic commercial, residential and public buildings on the same days throughout the state to make a large impact on the public and provide a cohesive branding, advertising and promotional opportunity for the host committees that participate. The Tour120 launch concept is simple: With our Host Sites’ participation, Preservation Kentucky will promote historic building tours on the same weekend this May in as many of the Commonwealth’s 120 counties as possible. The success of the Tour120 launch is our Host Sites’ participation in showcasing historic homes, commercial buildings and other historic places during the May 18-19 weekend which are usually closed to the public. Tour120 Program concept is uniquely for historic sites: Kentucky’s historic buildings and landscapes are our greatest amenities and define our sense of place, enhancing our downtowns, Main Streets, neighborhoods, rural and crossroads communities, and contributing to economic development and tourism efforts statewide. The keepers of many of these special places, however – cities, counties, nonprofits, museums and attractions – are challenged with a common problem: striking a balance between fundraising to carry out our mission and actually carrying out our mission. The Tour120 program is a year-long, year-round campaign designed to attract new visitors – and potentially new residents – and increase tourism and economic development dollars in cities across the state. Historic Preservation and Tourism are an important intersection: The positive economic and social impact of cultural heritage tourism cannot be overstated. This is especially true for a state like Kentucky, where iconic images have gained international attention and attracted visitors from all over the world. And while bourbon, horses and fried chicken are among our most popular icons, one can argue that it’s our historic architecture that gives us our strong sense of place. Tour120 is a wonderful way to showcase our historic buildings and sites: We believe the unified branding will appeal to local sites, spark interest in all age groups, and get folks out into their own and neighboring communities to explore the built environment that tells our story. THANK YOU TO OUR GENEROUS TOUR120 SPONSORS!
On January 25, 2016, a 55-year-old man was struck and killed while riding his bicycle in Wilkinsburg, near the city of Pittsburgh. The accident occurred around 6:30 p.m. in the eastbound lanes of the 400 block on Ardmore Boulevard. Police report that the driver, a 23-year-old woman, struck the man on his bicycle while she was on her way home from work. She stopped and stayed at the scene until emergency responders arrived. When police arrived, they said the victim was experiencing cardiac arrest and suffering from traumatic injuries. He was then taken to UPMC Mercy Hospital where he later died due to the severity of his injuries. Police cleared the woman of impairment and any criminal wrongdoing. An investigation is still ongoing. The victim was a member of many cycling organizations including BikePGH who released a statement regarding the accident. They believe the conditions on Ardmore Boulevard for bicyclists and pedestrians are inadequate. They also said this is one of many fatal bicycle accidents that have occurred on Ardmore Boulevard in the last ten years. As a motorist, it is important to share the road with bicyclists. When passing a bicyclist, the state requires four feet of space between your vehicle and the bicycle. Make sure you are always using turn signals so bicyclists know your intentions. Most importantly, avoid distracted driving such as using your cell phone while on the road. In this particular case, the victim’s family may file a civil wrongful death claim against the at-fault driver. Accidents can happen at any time and as a bicyclist it is important to know what your rights are. If you or a loved one were injured in an accident, contact the attorneys at Berger and Green for a free no obligation consultation to evaluate your case.

Fought battle with LG to fix washing machine. Service from repair man was great. Service from LG was horrible! As consumer had way too many phone calls to non English speaking customer service people that were just talking heads. Washer tells own problem, total of 8 to 10 calls to LG and took 3 months to fix. Purchased 5 LG products--What a mistake- Now have to live with them. DON'T BUY LG PRODUCTS-----SERVICE IS TOO BAD TO PUT INTO WORDS!!!!!!!!! our refrigerator was not cooling so they came out to diagnose and repair if that was feasible.. the repair individual was here promptly when he said he would be. He was very courteous, diagnosed the problem quickly and fixed it for us. He completely cleaned up any messes, water spills etc, was very courteous having to remove all the food from the refrigerator to put it back as taken out. he spent quite a bit of time on this repair so i felt the cost was reasonable. We had recently moved into this house so the refrigerator was new to me and he answered a lot of my questions about this appliance.
A plumber charges $496 to replace a kitchen sink and you can do it yourself for $265 and save 46 percent. Adjust the home improvement and repair cost with your ZIP Code. When it’s time to replace a kitchen sink, consider one made of stainless steel with new styling and design that offers more utility. Stainless steel is a good choice because the lightweight material is easier to handle and install, and it offers years of service without being vulnerable to chips and scratches. A plumber will charge $496 to replace an old kitchen sink with a new single-bowl 25-inch stainless bowl and faucet. This includes the labor and material. You can buy the sink and faucet for $265 and do it yourself, a 46 percent saving. If there's a dishwasher or garbage disposer with water lines that have to be disconnected and then reinstalled, figure on spending more time and money for the job. The first challenge may be removing the old sink, which requires some minor gymnastics working under the sink and unfastening it from the countertop. When you're looking at new sinks, consider one the same size or larger than the old one to fit into the hole. Then make the job easier by choosing one that installs from the top with self-leveling clips that snap in place so you don't have to work underneath the cabinet. If you’re installing a new faucet, do it before you position the sink in the countertop hole. Style-wise, choose a sink designed to fit your needs. One large single sink is a popular choice because you can handle large oversize pots and dishes in it. But for others, nothing beats a double sink where one is used for rinsing and the other for a dish drainer. Still others prefer a sink divided into three compartments with one in the center for a garbage disposer. This isn't a quicky job for a homeowner. Figure it'll take you about five hours to install a new sink, while a plumber can do it in about three hours. Here's a link to a Lowes video How to Install a Kitchen Sink. The bottom line: compare the price of a contractor’s bid to replace a kitchen sink with what it costs to do it yourself and make your decision. You adjust the cost to where you live by adding your ZIP Code.

Payroll team hits a bonus! Midland Heart is celebrating National Payroll Week, September 3-7, by highlighting the achievements of its own payroll team, which has been shortlisted for a prestigious national award. The housing association’s team is up for the In-house Payroll Team of the Year, awarded annually by the Chartered Institute of Payroll Professionals. Baljinder Kang, Executive Director of HR and Learning, Midland Heart, said: “When I first met the payroll team they were using manual processes and every month dealt with a large number of queries arising from pay errors. The team was not engaged with other HR colleagues and its image within the organisation was far from great. “Three years on the team has transformed its working practices and its reputation, adopted continuous improvement as its mantra, virtually eliminated pay errors and works collaboratively with HR and other teams across the business. Mike Sutton, Head of HR Shared Services & Reward, added; “I am proud to manage the team; proud of its results and their continued desire to improve, work together and engage with the business. Bringing the payroll, reward and shared services teams together as one team is one of the keys to this success and the pace improvement we can achieve together. The desire from the whole team to continually improve what they do is another key. As part of National Payroll Week, Dougie MacInnes, Payroll Manager, will be attending an event at the House of Commons, sponsored by Solihull MP, Julian Knight and the Chartered Institute of Payroll Professionals (CIPP). The event on September 4, is being held to help raise the profile of payroll and its impact on the UK economy.

Simon contacted me to consult on how we could turn his old site into something more dynamic, as well as add all his services as well as an online store all under one roof. I suggested that we build a new site on the WordPress platform and use WooCommerce as the online store, since this is a very simple and intuitive system to use. I was give full licence to design how I wish and really explore the tools available for this website. The end result is a fast loading and well presented site to give a feel of professionalism about the brand. Since launching the website the influx of traffic and new customers to purchase online has been great.

A three-try burst in six minutes raced Tonga away from the United States in a 40-12 rugby win at Kingsholm today. Tonga conceded an early try to the Eagles before edging ahead 14-12 by halftime. It was still that score when Tonga erupted with three quick tries, to No. 8 Viliami Maafu, fullback Vunga Lilo, and winger David Halaifonua. Kurt Morath converted two and Tonga suddenly led 33-12. The Tongans with a late converted try, their fifth, to captain Nili Latu won a second successive test for the first time in 18 months. Until they beat Georgia 23-9 in Tbilisi last week, the Tongans had not win their previous six tests. The United States started and finished the first half with tries to wing Tim Stanfill and flanker John Quill, in his first appearance this year, and managed to limit Tonga to three points while captain and flanker Scott LaValla was in the sin-bin. The Eagles, coming off a win over Romania, finish their European tour against Fiji in France next Friday, while Tonga meets Scotland in a week.

Careful with the cork, now. Pop. And close your eyes. Warm scents of cherry pie and cocoa. Black tea from nearby cafés in avenues of plum and pomegranate. You're nearby the ocean, soft heat rising from the earth. Hear the wash of the waves. Water breaking gently into foam. Cream. Like the surface of fine coffee. La Crema, as they call it on the Sonoma Coast. La Crema has remained under family control since it was founded in 1979. Located in the Russian River valley, Sonoma, California, the winery was established before the region gained reputation as one of the best regions for Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. Jess Jackson aquired the winery in 1993 and enhanced its reputation by elevating the quality of the wines it produced. The cool, windy climates of the vineyards allows them to create elegant yet expressive wines. New Zealand winemaker Craig McAllister joined the La Crema Winery in 2007, recently gaining the title of lead winemaker. Prior to his work here, he achieved his Viticulture and Oenology Bachelor of Science degree at Lincoln University, New Zealand and traveled the globe.
The blaze broke out in the early morning at a training center in Rio de Janeiro for teenage players at Flamengo, one of the most famous clubs. Prosecutors also expressed concern that Mr. Manafort was misleading them about his contacts with administration officials, the transcript of a court hearing shows. Fire swept through an unlicensed lodging at the training center of Rio de Janeiro soccer club Flamengo on Friday, killing 10 members of the club's youth team and injuring three more, one of them seriously, firefighters and news reports said. Inconsistency, which prompted Henrik Lundqvist to call out his teammates, has been the theme in an effort to integrate young talent under a new coach.

“Detectives from the Metropolitan Police Department’s First District seek the public’s assistance in identifying a person of interest in an Armed Robbery (Gun) offense that occurred on Thursday, November 23, 2017, in the 800 Block of H Street, Northeast.

The victim complied and the suspect fled the scene. The suspect was captured by a nearby surveillance camera and can be seen in the photos above.
SPAM is junkmail, but it is so much more than a nuisance. Reports show that over 50% of SPAM targets victims with Phishing attacks of some kind, using seemingly innocuous Email as clickbait or to steal personal information. With more and more desperate measures being taken by criminal organizations, there is also an increase in nuisance type SPAM. It can be difficult for the average person to appreciate the degree to which SPAM creates problems on a day to day basis, particularly when compared to the real threat of Identity Theft or other Credit Card fraud, however the threat is very real. The majority of all Phishing attacks and SPAM/Scam mail are not directly criminal, meaning that they merely facilitate aggressive advertising, nuisance advertising (failing to honor unsubscribes), or build Identity Theft profiles using your Personal Information- all of which can be sold. Remember, other than the rare cases of Industrial Espionage or targeted attacks directed toward you personally, it’s simply a numbers game driven by monetary reward. Whether or not you feel savvy enough to avoid falling prey to some Email scam, there are so many different types of scams that you will become a Phishing victim sometime in your life, even if you are very tech savvy. Imagining a future in which this doesn’t happen is possible, but it is absolutely unlikely unless significant changes happen. The MiCASA™ Public Trust (MPT) outlines a new platform that promises to end SPAM Email forever. The platform is not just about technology. It is technology serving a very real human concern about security and ethics. It stands to create a commercial zone whose security underpinnings maintain ethical communications and mutual respect. Fortunately, the technology to do this has already been imagined, it has already been built, and the only people who need to do things differently are you, the public. This isn’t about convincing lawmakers or lobbying Big Tech to change a thing. Your participation makes all the difference in the world, and the significance only grows as certain milestones are achieved. Sound lofty? This is about a Social System rather than Software. True enough, advanced technology fuels it all, but this is a technology-forward application whose aimed at the social good. It remains inclusive to all who would enter- private individuals as well as small business, non-profits and entrepreneurs- all except the Spammers, of course. The issue preventing sufficient regulation of Email to destroy bad SPAM are the topics of Commercial Interest, Privacy, and Trust. In reality nothing will slip by the demands of commercial interest. Generally speaking, laws in a free market society (most western type nations) will permit Direct Mail, Telemarketing, Text (Smartphone) Campaigns, and SPAM, and for this reason SPAM will probably always exist. Sustainable solutions to the SPAM problem will include a means to represent Commercial Interest in a positive fashion, but in a way that is different than it is done now. Private organizations have a difficult time dealing with SPAM as well as serving the needs of regular contact between members of their organization and the rest of the world. Taking the case of corporate mail alone, the current Solution regarded as most effective is strict Whitelisting. The problem remains that Whitelisting is too restrictive and it precludes regular access that such organizations need to conduct business in the real world. Lookahead: Given the fact that Email addresses, just like Street addresses are open to the public, and that most SPAM, Scam, and hacker emails avoid any certainty about their actual origin- this is precisely the problem addressed by MiCASA’s Authentication Solution using IPAL. Solving the problem of bad SPAM cannot be left to a Whitelist alone as this closes off the system. The system needs to breathe to remain vital, and Whitelists are simply too air-tight. What if a Virtual Whitelist could be constructed- one which had acceptable rates of access, and one which in fact solved the problem which makes Whitelists in a Corporation too restrictive- what if the process to become Whitelisted were both automated and ensured compliance with Community standards? This component to the system provides more or less “public” access and yet still enforces Community guidelines. Turning towards the issue of Privacy when reviewing potential Solutions, note it is nearly impossible to implement a system that solves for bad SPAM while retaining Privacy. Of course, privacy in the modern world is a matter of degrees. Regarding privacy in a pure sense, take a moment to think of a business such as Google or Microsoft launching a campaign promising Privacy along with their Big Tech solution for SPAM free Email. Such a thing might fail based on the perceived lack of trust alone. Would it really be a bad thing? That much is unclear. What remains true is that Privacy in a Virtual Whitelist Environment would require a significant amount of Trust. Setting aside the relationship between Privacy and Trust for a moment- it is after all a balance point similar to the issue of Restriction and Access in the case of the Whitelist above- there is yet a technical challenge with Privacy in the proposed Solution. Assuming the Solution works like most VPN’s (Virtual Private Networks) the chief problem with Privacy is that the entire network potentially has access to internal communications. This may sound like Security and Privacy are at risk, but let us just focus on Privacy: while Privacy is guaranteed against those outside the Network, inside it is a little difficult. Again, assuming that the software solves all the problems of Security and Privacy between members, what remains is Privacy with the actual Administration of the system. When all else is accounted for, the System itself would have access to every mail ever sent, and in a proposed Solution serving several classes of individuals from private to commercial to other interests, this single point of exposure becomes the critical issue regarding Privacy and Security. One Solution is to require Double-blind communications between all participants in the system including the system administrators and the system itself! This article is too limited in scope to speak on this point. Identifying this point is sufficient- and significant. “Form Fits Function” is a truth of technology so dry it’s almost laconic. But if you have kept up so far, this is where Blockchain makes a Cameo and it may keep you through to the end. Blockchain is the most hyped technology of the day (c.2018), and while Bellasys does not really call it hype, Blockchain is neither flawed, pointless, nor in itself truly a technology. Controversy aside, the worst use-case for any technological component is because it looks good, or sounds good. While there is nothing wrong with finding useful and legitimate/legitimizing applications for hype and fanware, it rarely makes for good systems architecture. The compelling use case for Blockchain here is the highly specialized system of Authentication (IPAL Technology) providing certitude that among all the possible machines sending and receiving mail on the network, those machines are absolutely, positively authenticated and therefore traceable in an otherwise private and secure double-blind virtual network. This is one critically placed point bridging Privacy, and Trust. Without certitude about the origin of mail, there isn’t any means to enforce ethical conduct and community standards. This addresses the exact nature of the current problem today, and the chief difference between email open to the world and Email managed in a Network free of SPAM. Imagine for a moment that this was not a deal-breaker. in that case the issue simply becomes filtering out unwanted mail, and this is possible today thanks to many tools already created and utilized by all of the major Email service providers, including individual domain servers. In brief- after taking out the “bad guys”, handling Email preferences and Settings becomes nearly trivial. The Solution and Systems Architecture proposed by MiCASA™ could be easily implemented as a commercial service; however, it is intentionally designed to not only promote transparency and ethical communications in its network, it enforces it. The only single private interest the system is responsible for is the Community itself, and collectively even the community isn’t a real entity, but rather, thanks to it’s decentralized nature, it is a virtual construct that can evolve based on the needs of the Community while still retaining it’s core values as an egalitarian construct. Clicking a link inside a Phishing Email is the Coup De Grace… but it’s not the only target. We live in a tech landscape that is anything but straightforward, and here’s a great example: how is it that one of the most common attacks is the act of stealing your Email address? If “they” already have it, meaning you have already received an email at your address, why is opening it a problem if you don’t click any links inside? Typical Spammers and Scammers need to keep their “reputation” high to work with the way most bulk email services are wired. Too many “bounced” emails sent to defunct
We meet every Thursday, year round, except Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year’s, from 7-8 am in the church sanctuary. Our God calls us to love, to seek justice, to be peacemakers, to care for all creation. None of this outer action happens without inner transformation and support. The place where inner change happens is your heart and one pathway to that change is contemplative or centering prayer. The contemplative/centering prayer group meets every Thursday morning, 7-8 am, in the sanctuary. Yes it’s early – 7 AM – but the UCC sanctuary is amazingly peaceful at that time. What do we do there? We sit in silence, for about 25 minutes. Some of us practice Centering Prayer, some use other forms of silent meditation. It’s up to you, but if you need some guidance in a meditation practice, we are happy to help. We hear inspiration from writers and poets who words are open-hearted, encouraging and sometimes challenging. We listen, in the silence, to small parts of scripture, listening for how it applies to our own lives. We share ‘prayers of the people’ and hold all prayers not only in confidence but also before God. The whole session lasts until about 8 AM, but it’s easy to slip out after the silent meditation if one needs to. This group has been meeting continuously since 2000; it is open to all and we would love to have you join us. Willigis Jaegar, a Benedictine monk and Zen Roshi, has this to say about our practice: “It is a practice that reaches beyond ‘private prayer’ to a realization of our oneness in God and our connection with and in loving service for all the world, not just at specific times of prayer but also in every moment, in all circumstances and conditions of ordinary daily life: while working, exercising, attending meetings, washing dishes, visiting with friends, engaging in acts of service. It is the means for our lives becoming “ceaseless prayer” and abiding always in the heart of Christ. We invite you to join us on Thursdays at 7 am. Please get in touch if you have any questions.
Ahh, dessert. Dessert is the ultimate treat and it’s always something that we love to enjoy at the end of a meal. However, when you switch to a healthier lifestyle the idea of enjoying a bowl of ice cream or a slice of cake seems like a world away. But don’t fret, because today we have a few healthier dessert options which you absolutely HAVE to try this week. Sometimes the most simple treat is the best. Yogurt and fruit is a classic combination and is one which can be amazing at any time of the day. As a dessert, you can make your own yogurt with Yogurt Nerd and then top it with your favorite fruits and granola for a bit of crunch. It’s summer now, and there is nothing better than having a refreshing bowl of ice cream on a hot day. If you are trying to be healthy and you don’t want to eat ice cream, there is a great alternative which is super healthy and incredibly indulgent too. Nice cream can be made by combining 3 frozen bananas in a blender with a splash of your favorite nut milk, alongside your flavoring. It could be peanut butter, Nutella, caramel or even berries. You’ll end up with a smooth, refreshing and creamy ice cream which is totally vegan and much healthier! If you want a comforting winter dessert on a cold night in, you can create a spin on the classic apple crumble by baking an apple, making a crumble topping and sprinkling it over the top. You can then top with some cream and you have a yummy low carb dessert to enjoy. Avocados are like the holy grail for healthy food lovers, and you can use them in so many different ways to create some awesome dishes. For the most creamy and wonderful brownies you ever tasted, combine a couple of avocados with flour, sugar, cocoa powder and vegan chocolate before baking in the oven for fudgy, creamy and wonderful brownies. Sometimes on a hot day up want something which feels like a treat but is also incredibly refreshing. Watermelon is a fruit which is full of water and can be a great snack for a hot summer’s day. You can create a slice of watermelon into a pizza by topping it with other fruits and even a little drizzle of homemade Nutella. This can make a great side dish for a barbecue and will look stunning on a platter. Chia seeds are tiny little seeds which pack a huge punch of protein and fiber to your day. They are an amazing superfood and when soaked, they expand to create a jelly-like consistency. You can make the most of this by creating a chia seed pudding overnight to enjoy the next day. You’ll need a few tablespoons of chia seeds, a cup of nut milk, cocoa powder, peanut butter, banana slices and blueberries. Mix it all together in a jar, seal and leave until the next day. You will end up with a creamy, yummy chocolate pudding with fruity flavors mixed in. What are your favorite healthy desserts? Healthier dessert options are possible and they can be delicious too. Be sure to sign up for our newsletter to get healthy tips and tricks and access to my free printables library! Does Your Morning Coffee Affect Your Confidence? I’m a fan of EVERYTHING on this list except for watermelon and avocado. I really try to enjoy these things but I can’t get past the taste!! I wonder if you taste it in the avocado brownies? I seem to always be able to detect it…LOL. Anyways I really enjoyed this post. The chia pudding and fruit + yogurt combo are eaten on a daily basis in my house. These are all body loving foods! Great list, thanks for sharing!

Last night, I had a nightmare that all my chisels had rusted over and bellied. So this morning, during my breakfast of mini-bagel and green tea, I made sure they had not. I actually only got through 1/4-5/8, and will do the rest tonight. I love my 3×8 diamond plates for grinding and sharpening, but they are not ideal for lapping and flattening. When I need something perfectly flat, I turn instead to the machinist’s granite slab pictured above and adhesive-backed sandpaper of various coarseness. For flattening chisels or plane irons, I typically use 80 grit, 120 grit and 220 grit sandpaper. I care more about flatness than mirror polish, so any additional polishing done on the diamond plates in the course of sharpening. For plane soles, I might go up to 320 grit (which is overkill for everything but a smoothing plane, I know). I’ve experimented with sanding belts and spray adhesive in the past, but I’m never happy with the adhesion, and certainly loathe the mineral-spirits cleanup of the spray adhesive. With adhesive-backed sandpaper, I just need a scraper and a spritz of Simple Green cleaner. The grit on the sanding belts definitely lasts longer, but it’s a small price to pay. Where do you get your sandpaper? I have some adhesive backed rolls I inherited from a cabinet shop I used to work for, and I’m running out. Amazon. Porter cable 10yd rolls. Pricing isn’t bad. Awesome Website! I’m glad to have found it in it’s begining to reveiw all your posts. Minimal space, tools and fine works. Please continue and I will read and learn.
It’s hard to think of another part of the country that offers wing-shooters a greater variety of feathered game than Montana. From grouse, partridge, and pheasants in upland cover to ducks and geese on streams, lakes, and potholes, Montana bird hunters have it about as good as it ever gets. When evaluating new places, I always consider water first. Everything we hunt needs water—ducks and geese because they live there, upland game because waterways often provide the optimal combination of shelter and nutrition. As with any endeavor in the field, adapting technique and going prepared optimize the chances of hunting safely and comfortably, and enjoying a great wild-game dinner at the end of the day. As every hunter should learn at an early age, safety comes first. On average, 15 people die by drowning in Montana every year. Granted, the chance of that happening on a pheasant hunt are remote. However, any time watercraft are involved, either to set out duck decoys or to access river-bottom upland cover, common-sense precautions are mandatory—and that includes appropriate (and legal) flotation devices. Water is most dangerous when it isn’t water at all, but ice. Falling through can turn into an emergency quickly, for hunters and especially for their dogs, especially when ice shelves partially or completely overlie running water. As a rule, never work a dog in moving water upstream from ice. While serious accidents are rare, getting wet after falling through ice is common. The dogs won’t mind but I sure do, especially when I’m hunting in sub-zero temperatures. Just getting wet up to your knees can end a hunt quickly in such conditions. This is especially easy to do in the terrain around Bozeman, where the local hydrology produces spring-fed creeks. Because they issue from the ground at a constant temperature, these streams freeze slowly and irregularly—a prime reason why they produce such great late-season waterfowl hunting. On streams like this, ice that will support your weight easily in one place may collapse beneath you in another. All ice looks the same under a couple of inches of fresh powder, so it’s best to travel on dry ground. If you have to cross a frozen stream, choose the location carefully (avoid areas of increased flow below beaver dams, for example) and proceed with caution. If you’re hunting on ice overlying water deeper than your waist, be sure to familiarize yourself with self-rescue techniques. Footwear becomes a special consideration when hunting near waterways. Waders are often mandatory when hunting waterfowl even during the early season, especially if you plan to set out decoys. (You can sometimes get around this by using self-righting decoys that can be pitched onto the water from shore and carrying a collapsible boat-hook to retrieve them.) I spend a surprising amount of time hunting pheasants while wearing waders, since some of my favorite cover requires multiple creek-crossings to hunt it effectively. Chest waders are usually more practical for waterfowl over decoys, but they are clumsy. When hunting upland birds in creek-bottom habitat, I prefer hip waders. “Ankle-fit” models make hiking easier. Water can become a tactical ally when hunting pheasants that would rather run than fly. They don’t swim, and hunters can use the bends in wandering prairie streams to their advantage by pushing running birds ahead of them through thick cover until they have nowhere else to go but up. Game recovery—both a practical and an ethical concern—can be a challenge when hunting near water. There is simply no substitute for a trained retriever, and if you or your hunting partners don’t have one, you should probably be hunting somewhere else. During the early upland season, my German wirehair pointers do fine, but once temperatures drop or waterfowl become the quarry, I don’t leave home without one of my labs. Don’t worry about them getting cold and wet—they’re bred for the job and there’s nothing they’d rather be doing. The legal aspects of hunting Montana waterways warrant discussion. Our stream-access law insures the public’s right to float navigable waterways and recreate between the mean highwater marks. It does not provide the right to shoot across private property or retrieve downed game from private land. In general, islands in larger rivers that were islands at the time of statehood lie in the public domain. Confusion arises when rivers naturally form new channels, creating islands that did not previously exist. Investigate legal rights and restrictions in the area you plan to hunt, and always respect private property. Most of our larger streams flow through public property at various points along the way, and GPS technology now makes these legally accessible lands easy to identify in the field. Don’t be deterred by the prospect of ice, mud, wet feet, and wet dogs. Whether your interest lies in waterfowl, upland game, or both, Montana’s waterways offer wonderful wing-shooting opportunities—and a great excuse for owning a retriever. Or two.
Notwithstanding whether you have just heard about self-empowerment training from your friend or colleagues or perhaps you have tried it first-hand, what matters most is that you will gain knowledge about what it really is and also, about how it can benefit you the most. Honestly speaking, this kind of training is by far different from other trainings you may have heard of before. For those of you out there who are wondering why self-empowerment training is not the same as any other trainings you know or heard of, that would be because this particular training focuses more on rebuilding and making a much better version of yourself. Since we mention about training, you should know that self-empowerment training also has lots of empowerment training courses that a person can choose from and one of which is the Avatar Course. One good thing about undergoing these training courses is that there will be life coaches who will guide you, indulge you and even motivate you to become the best person you can be while discovering who you really are and what potential do you have as a person. For those who are planning on becoming a life coach someday, you may take the avatar professional course. If you want to undergo self-empowerment training at the comfort and convenience of your home, there is an avator software that you can use for this matter. When it comes to training about self-empowerment, we want you to know as well that it is not all about your rediscovering yourself and reinventing it to make a better version, it also about your achieving all the goals you have in life and knowing what your purpose is in living in this world. The compassion project is one of the projects that falls under the self-empowerment training and speaking of which, this is the kind of training wherein individuals have to show compassion or act compassionately towards others, especially those who are in need. Regarding the compassion project, those who are orchestrating the said event are giving their beneficiaries what we call as compassion cards. If you want to know more about compassion projects and compassion cards, there are lots of websites online that you can visit and Click! Since we have already mentioned to you about important facts regarding self-empowerment training and the things that you should expect from it, before you decide to enroll yourself in one of its classes, you have to first fully understand its importance and how it will greatly affect you at the end of your session. To simply put, you can compare this kind of thing to a birthright wherein it has already been within you, waiting to be realized and recognized.

Progress of a collected Needle Juniper… Collected from the edge of a swamp. This juniper had grown very tall and slender over the many years it had been there, reaching for the light. As the level of the swamp water rose in winters passed, it rotted out the trunk on the water side. This gave it a nice natural shari running up the trunk. This was the only redeeming feature, and main reason for collecting it. The other being that I love the challenge of bending straight trunks to create interesting trees from otherwise poor material. Juniper a few years after collection. The image above shows the tree once I had reduced it’s height, removing more than a metre off the top. Prior to this I nurtured a tiny little bud on the trunk for a few years until it had enough growth to become the foliage for the entire tree… Heavy feeding and unrestrained growth got that little bud to the foliage mass you see above. After splitting the live vein away from the deadwood. Splitting the trunk and bringing the live vein downward would enable us to get a really compact tree. This would also add a nice characteristic deadwood curve for the apex to eventually sit into and grow over. Although the tree has come a long way since it’s swampy days (it was nice getting it into a pot I made last year), a few things need to be addressed to get it looking good, including refinement of the foliage pads, and removing a large root at the back so we can get the tree sitting lower in the pot.

Tonight Tejano Ranch welcomes back the Tejano-Norteño group, Sólido. The Rio Grande City-based band is often categorized with other groups like Duelo, Siggno, and Intocable, all of whom play a style that some call “Texas Norteño,” borrowing from both Tejano and Norteño, which are related, but still quite different. Sólido describes their sound as “romantic and melodic, ideal for dancing and singing,” and has remained popular and productive since the group’s nearly overnight rise to fame after signing with Freddie Records in the early 2000s. Their discography includes the albums Hasta La Cima Del Cielo, Nadie Como Tú (which won the 2001 Grammy Award for Best Tejano Album), Por Ti, Vuelve, En Vivo Contigo, Nuestro Amor, Cuidado, Que Importa, and their latest album, Te Va A Doler. The group has also been in the studio recently and is planning a new release very soon. Long story short: It’s a good night for anyone who loves Ramón Ayala, and the faster and slightly different flavor of Norteño.

This nutrition powerhouse is a fast-growing tree that originates from India, but can now be found all over Asia and subtropical locations. Every part of the tree can be used for its various healing properties. It’s been called the “miracle tree” for its nutritional assets for malnourished peoples in developing countries, even in times of drought. Although relatively new to the US, it’s been used for centuries in areas of Asia and Africa. In this article we’ll discuss the benefits, where to find it and how to use it– make sure to the RECIPES at the end! 1. What are the benefits of Moringa? Moringa has been used for centuries in the Ayurvedic and Unani systems of traditional medicine, touting remedies for over 300 ailments! One day I got a really nice box in the mail that was filled with Moringa! I was intrigued. So, it was time for me to give it a go. Moringa Oleifera is a fast growing, drought resistant, tropical tree that is arguably one of the world’s most nutritious plants! Recently this tree is getting more exposure and, as a result, grabbing the attention of health-conscious Americans. Although relatively new to the US, Moringa has been used for centuries in areas of Asia and Africa; after all, it is a tropical tree. The tiny leaves, which have a strong taste with a bite like horseradish, are highly acclaimed for both their nutritional and medicinal properties. The seed pods are also edible and are nutritionally similar but not as potent as the leaves. Moringa seed oil has many unique and beneficial properties typically not found in a single source. This makes the oil coveted in the cosmetic and health and beauty world! To date, researchers and scientists have only investigated a fraction of the claimed health benefits of Moringa. Below is a brief summary.

It may run at dangerously high speed on no load. In case of small series motors brake test may be employed. The series motors are usually tested in pairs. The field test is applied to two similar series motors which are coupled mechanically. The connection diagram for the test is shown in the Fig. 1. As shown in the Fig. 1 one machine is made to run as a motor while the other as a generator which is separately excited. The field of the two machines are connected in series so that both the machines are equally excited. This will make iron losses same for the two machines. The two machines are running at the same speed. The generator output is given to the variable resistance R. The resistance R is changed until the current taken by motor reaches full load value. This will be indicated by ammeter A1. The other readings of different meters are then recorded. Since the two machines are equally excited and are running at same speed the stray loses are equally divided. Efficiency of generator is of little importance because it is running under conditions of separate excitation. Still it can be found as follows. The important point to be noted is that this is not regenerative method though the two machines are mechanically coupled because the generator output is not fed back to the motor as in case of Hopkinson's test but it is wasted in load resistance.

Filmed over 10 years, this controversial documentary explores what it's really like to become famous. When aspiring filmmaker Tony Zierra resorts to filming the lives of his 4 struggling actor roommates, he never imagines the incredible twists of fate he would end up capturing on camera. Surprisingly, 3 of the actors, Brad Rowe (Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss), Chad Lindberg (October Sky, The Fast And The Furious) and Wes Bentley (American Beauty, The Hunger Games) quickly hit it big. Meanwhile, the fourth actor, Greg Fawcett, is nearly driven insane watching the others make it. It doesn't take long for the unsettling reality of stardom to set in. As the actors deal with life in the public eye, Zierra struggles with constant obstacles trying to complete his film. Ultimately, the roommates learn the hard way that the Hollywood Dream is built on the bottom line.Â My Big Break is an unflinching look at the struggle for success, the high of making it and ultimately the pain of losing it.

Cameron Brewer has been an Auckland Councillor for six years. Last year he and his wife Kate moved their young family to Riverhead. Having grown up on a sheep farm in Taranaki, Cameron loves the Northwest lifestyle but is frustrated at the infrastructural shortcomings that fall behind the population growth. The NZ Herald gave Cameron an ‘A’ for his performance on council, describing him as one of the most effective councillors. He is well known in New Zealand political and business circles having worked as a communications adviser to Prime Minister Jenny Shipley, Act Leader Rodney Hide, and Mayor of Auckland City John Banks. The 43-year-old has worked as a journalist and publisher of a community newspaper he founded. He currently runs his own public relations company. For five years he was the high profile and successful Chief Executive of the Newmarket Business Association, before being elected by a huge majority to the inaugural Auckland Council in 2010. He was re-elected unopposed as the Councillor for Orakei in 2013. Cameron is standing with the Rodney First team to add experience and vision and bringing his ability to publicly raise issues and get results and to help put Rodney first. A current Local Board member, ratepayer and businessman Phelan devotes significant time to our community and lives in Muriwai with his wife Allison. He is director and shareholder of Best Berries in Huapai. His community roles reflect his values, whether it is as a trustee on the Muriwai Environmental Action Community Trust or the Officer in Charge of Muriwai Fire Brigade, he is dedicated to serving the community. Phelan has chaired the Local Board’s Transport, Planning and Infrastructure Committee. Among his achievements he has helped deliver a Centre Plan for Huapai and Kumeu plus millions of dollars of footpaths for the area. Phelan has actively worked with the community over the last three years to improve outcomes for the district, helping groups and individuals with council related issues. Phelan believes the Rodney Local Board could perform better with skilled members prepared to work together. He feels the huge challenges the Board faces with population growth must be tackled by an experienced team that understands how Auckland Council works. He is passionate about the district’s future, so this election the Rodney First team has been formed to give voters a choice with experienced candidates sharing clear goals and vision for Rodney. Brent is a local ratepayer and businessman who has worked in IT and Telecommunications for many years. Living on the border of Kaukapakapa and Helensville in Peak Road, he is passionate about the creation of new employment and enterprise opportunities for Rodney residents. A Board of Trustees member at Kaipara College and keen advocate for community development in South Kaipara, Brent has also served on the Te Whare Oranga o Parakai steering committee. Brent believes that the unprecedented population growth planned for Rodney should be accompanied by commensurate increases in funding for roading, infrastructure, public transport and community facilities. By working together Rodney First board members can demonstrate a common focus and collaborate on a shared work plan delivering a better outcome for Rodney as together we can be more than the sum of our parts. Brent brings a business sense and a fresh perspective on how the local board can improve community based collaboration and outcomes.

As stated earlier on, digital signs are used to display a variety of applications and technologies that substantially help in the advertising and promotion of a business. You’ve probably seen digital screens arriving in many places such as super markets, public transportation, etc. Normally it may be said that digital signage completely refers to an electronically controlled screen or sets of screens which can be remotely updated over the internet without any cost or expense of changing the physical posters. As a result it is very easy and economical to change your targeted message and can be updated on hundreds or countless displays at a time. This new industry has led to product innovations to project images and video directly on the store windows using a reverse image screen. It is very important to use the right digital signage software package to ensure that the correct message should appear at the right time. As an example: let’s say you have a business selling a variety of paint from different manufactures all on one shelf. Customer ‘A’ walks in and needs paint but not exactly sure which manufacturer to go with and would like more information. With a digital screen over that isle delivering more information to your client while they wait for you to wrap up and greet them, they can be watching a short paid advertising presentation from one of your manufacturers. Signera is a leading provider of the following solutions related to digital signage: Digital Signage Software, Digital Media Network, Out-of-Home Television TV, Interactive Kiosks, Digital Display Networks, Digital Note Boards, Digital OOH Networks, Dynamic Digital Signage Solutions, Digital Advertising, Digital Marketing, Electronic Message Boards, Wireless Digital Signage, Digital Signage Solutions, Out-of-Home Media Networks, High Definition HD Digital Signage, Dynamic Digital Signs, Digital Bulletin Boards, Digital Signs, Digital Signage System, Digital Signage Networks, Digital Information Display, Dynamic Digital Signage Software, Digital Signage ASP, Narrow-casting DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Advertising, Digital Signage Enterprise Software, Captive Audience Networks, Electronic Leader Boards, Digital Signage Application Service Provider, Digital Signage.

Gaspar's Best Crave Control causes a significant release of dopamine. This constant release of possibly therapeutic amounts of dopamine promotes appetite suppression and reduces overall craving in general. Low dopamine levels cause cravings that lead to overeating and carbohydrate binging. The main ingredient is "DL-Phenylalanine". "D-Phenylalanine" is an amino acid that promotes the release of dopamine and is considered a prescription drug. "DL-Phenylalanine" (which is in this supplement) is a neutraceutical (food containing health-giving additives and having a medicinal benefit) and has the same effect, but at a reduced strength. The other ingredients within the supplements are there to ensure that healthy levels of dopamine are maintained once the appropriate levels are reached. This is an effective diet control supplement for those seeking help with cravings or portion control. Please consult your healthcare professional if you are nursing, pregnant, or taking other medications before taking this supplement.

Two Catholic primary schools in Peterborough and another in Cambridge are among the first to be proposed amid a new round of government funding for voluntary aided (VA) faith schools in England. The three bids are in areas of significant housing development where there is a shortage of school places, and if approved would open in September 2022 or 2023. The Department for Education (DfE) announced plans to open new VA faith schools in May 2018. It made the decision after campaigning by the National Secular Society (NSS) and others forced it to abandon plans to scrap a 50% cap on discriminatory admissions to new academies. VA faith schools are able to teach confessional religious education and select all pupils (and potentially all staff) on religious grounds. In December the NSS wrote to all local authorities including Peterborough, urging them to resist proposals for new VA faith schools. The letter also urged councils to monitor the impact of faith-based education on school choice in the wake of the publication of the NSS's recent report The Choice Delusion. In the same month, the DfE's own impact assessment showed its decision to fund new VA schools would lead to religious discrimination in admissions, through their teaching of denominational RE and in their employment practices. The assessment also showed the move would undermine social cohesion. No More Faith Schools campaigner Alastair Lichten said: "Local councils should be standing up for all their residents, not facilitating discrimination. We will continue to monitor new VA school proposals as they come in and engage with local councils, councillors and activists to ensure they are challenged. Councils have a duty to ensure adequate school provision which if fulfilled leave little room for such discriminatory proposals. "Supporters can read our guide to challenging new faith schools and get in touch for further advice." Helen Bates, assistant director for schools at the Diocese of East Anglia, told the Peterborough Telegraph: "This bidding round represents the first opportunity to build new Catholic schools in East Anglia for many years." Mr Lichten called this claim "misleading". "The offer has always been open to Catholic groups to open new state funded academies. However they refuse to do so unless they are able to apply 100% religious selection." The Peterborough Telegraph's article originally stated that the schools would be free schools (academies). The paper corrected this after being contacted by the No More Faith Schools campaign. Should the schools be approved they may later convert to academy status.
Places to stop off in central London that are baby/toddler friendly! Out and about? Need a place to feed and change? Need a place for baby or toddler to get out of the pram and stretch their legs, run around, have a play? A good open space up on floor 6. We went up here to let our 13 month old get out of the buggy after a long nap to crawl and toddle around. They use this space for events but events are not a regular occurrence so the space was empty. There is plenty of space up there. **update** April 2015 – they now have additional seating for the cafe on this floor. I don’t know if it is temporary or not but there was still space up there to walk/crawl around and look out of the window onto the cafe or out onto the road outside. It was also nice and quiet up there with plenty of table space if you have a few people that need to sit around a table. Safety first: this is obviously a shop and not a children’s play area/provider. Check with staff if you have any safety concerns and always supervise activities closely.

Tell us your thoughts about Exuviance CoverBlend Concealing Treatment Makeup SPF 30 so we can help you find the right products. With your review, you’ll also receive 50 Rewards Points. Please note that it may take up to 72 hours for a review to appear on site. All reviews are subject to moderator approval. CoverBlend conceals age spots and dark circles under my eyes very well. With the wide range of skin tones, I have found exactly the right one to blend with my skin. With my makeup, I appear to be much younger than I am. Only the dispenser is not five stars. It dispenses controlled amounts very well. However, when it no longer dispensed, I cut the tube open and found a large amount of the product remaining inside. I scraped it into an eye treatment container and it filled to the top. There are many weeks of makeup which might have been tossed out. I've been using this for years and started buying it from LovelySkin because of the great price and rewards. It's the brand my dermatologist recommends. I absolutely love this foundation! The lightest shade is perfect for my Scandinavian skin! I was really surprised at how heavy and difficult to blend this Exuviance Cover Blend Make-up is given the number of good reviews I had read. I realize it is a concealing make-up, so I expected it to be thicker and heavier than standard foundation. However, it was like spreading plaster on my face. Even after trying to mix it with some moisturizer to thin it out some, I could not get it to blend well enough that I could even leave the house in it! I was forced to wash my face and start over. I suppose you could use this for a very small spot cover and blend it in--but using it for foundation or even for dark circles under the eyes is out of the question for me. I'm experienced in using make-up and have tried many types and brands, but I could never use or recommend this one. Complimentary pigmented concealer works great! When I need a pigmented concealer this is a must have! Perfect for those temporary blemishes or discoloration from moustache tweezing! This is the best concealer I have ever used. It not only works effectively, but it is also healthy for your skin. Not cakey at all. You do need to moisturize your skin before using, as it can be a little drying. Im very pleased with this purchase. Excellent coverage that lasts all day. A small dab is all it takes. I think this is a great product I have not been able to find any other product that helps conceal alot of my imperfections on my skin. I really like this product. It covers well and stays on all day which is hard to find. It makes you complexion look smooth and flawless. You don't need to use very much. I buy a lighter shade and darker so I can blend to my skintone and the time of year when my skintone changes from being outside varies.
Last night, Saturday, April 2, 2011; Darnette and I watched the new DVD “The Klaus Dona Chronicles – Secret World 1” and the photos, data presented and described by Klaus Dona were incredible….! Images, artifacts, data of never seen before shelved items that will open your mind to the SECRET WORLD that was here before US…! And the questions that want answers quickly come to mind as these artifacts, created by WHOM? and showing in great detail WHAT? Before Us….! I have known Klaus Dona for a number of years and to talk with him is a pleasure beyond understanding, as Klaus shares ‘hidden’ data for the inquiring mind to consider..? The Klaus Dona website is http://www.unsolved-mysteries.info and just click onto language you know to read…New DVD out: “The Klaus Dona Chronicles – Secret World 1” can be purchased from Amazon: http://amazon.com with artifacts that will shock as Klaus explains the many enigmas surrounding the artifacts, data, truth! The photo image at the top of today’s Blog is a recent image taken of the Sun and posted on the Space Weather News website http://www.spaceweather.com where you can keep up with the latest Sun activity & data, with the ever changing reports and the WAITING for an EVENT from same….! Stan & Holly Deyo work many hours, producing UPDATED news from around the world on a daily basis. Holly must never sleep…? Their website http://standeyo.com is updated as quickly as news changes and I’ve never seen Stan so busy with radio shows…! Stan was recently on Coast To Coast AM with George Noory, warning of connections he found in data between Japan’s quakes and Yellowstone. http://www.coasttocoastam.com Also with recent reports from Guy, Arkansas region/New Madrid and West Coast trouble….! YEA!!!!! Can hardly wait to here you talk with GeorgeAnn! LARRY, LATELY I HAVE FELT THE EARTH CHANGES IN MY BODY AND SPIRIT. UNDER A STRAIN TOO SPEND A LOT OF TIME OUT , CAN SHE BE TELLING US SOMETHING IS IN THE WIND . THANKS FOR LISTENING LOVE YOU ALL . I have also been having a lot of body pain and feel so drained…more than usual!! I was to move north from the city on May 1st and for some strange reason, i was stopped from doing so….life gets stranger and stranger!! I dont know what is next for me! I know exactly what you are saying Vaughn. I have been feeling really run down for the last 6 weeks or so. The weeks are passing by very quickly and by body cannot play catch up. Anyone else feeling run down? Hey that is what I got for the day. Maybe there is something to it maybe not. I believe the Lord has just led me to that. Take it for what it is. When we see all these things happen the Lord says to hold your head up cause your redemption draws nigh. Hey Hey Hey I gotta go. Looking forward the your talk with George Ann Larry! Re the delusion..I think (here at least) many refuse to acknowledge through fear. Like an ostrich they bury their heads hoping it will all go away. Unfortunately, the rest of their backsides remain in full site so they will end up with a whuppin’, as you guys say over the pond. There was a 3.5 earthquake in Blackpool – a resort on the coast of Lancashire (west coast). Never known one there before? Still, that’s our mini Las Vegas these days. Maybe a warning? Who knows. Yes the winds of change are blowing Larry, picking up speed and blowing stronger. Here in Alliston, Ontario/CDA, what with the Japan ( manipulated or natural) catastrophe, we are just starting to reap the domino effect. Honda CDA is not receiving there auto parts from Japan. As of right now work has been reduced to 4 hour days for us at Simcoe Parts Services. We are a 400.000 sq. ft. 2/warehouse. All Honda vender’s ship there parts to us and we sequence them in lot ranges and then send them to Honda just in time. We are hearing that by April 15/16 we will run out of parts from Japan. Here we go, what will happen next, because Honda supports all this area, similar to GM and Detroit. I know the NWO bunch are not structured, they are flexible, so this could be 2 steps forward and 1 step back. All in all my faith is on Jesus Christ our solid Rock, all other ground is sinking sand, Amen. Come Lord Jesus come. I know there will be an economic collapse and then WW3. They will set up there NWO. But at the end Jesus will come back and destroy it by pouring down His wrath on them. Glory be to Jesus, for His bride is NOT appointed unto wrath. Thank you for your continued posts. I have been listening a lot lately to Steve Quayle’s shows that he did in March and WOW, if you haven’t had a chance to listen, I hope you will. I’m sure it’s a lot of things you already know. He’s been on Omegaman and Hagman & Hagman on blog talk radio. I love your & Stewarts updates, thank you for all your hard work. Outstanding DVD!!! Nothing is a surprise anymore…but it is amazing that we can still buy the truth such as described by Klaus. is an outstanding complimentary site to review after watching Klaus’ DVD. Larry, I enjoyed watching the klaus Dona. Movie with you. These are the things we all have thought about or dreamed of. Outstanding movie and I enjoyed our time together. Love you…..D. Can you believe it Larry? My move didnt pan out and i dont know what is in store for me now…i wait on the Lord! God bless you and Darnette!! Re the comments on tiredness etc. I was told about Diatomaceous Earth (food grade) and wheatgrass. Since I have been taking this daily, I have found my health improving. I suffer with arthritis in my joints and spine and even the pain there has eased. These also remove metals from the body and, in light of what is happening today, we need that! Check this out folks. I prayed Father would show me, as He created our bodies and knows what we need for health and I was innundated with information. Read it all up folks!! You will not regret it! Can you stand one more complaint. I live in Kentucky, and I am literally exhausted. From what, I do not know. I am a stay at home retired registered nurse, and it is all I can do to make myself get out of bed. When I get out of bed, I go directly to my recliner. I am not depressed and I am not an old lady. My husband still works, and he sleeps in his chair like an 80-year-old man, even though he is in his fifties. We are both very active and exercise faithfully every day. The last several weeks have played a toll on both my husband and I. Our three grown children are also complaining of this strange lethargy that has bombarded us. We are not idle folks, and this is what makes it so unsettling. I have a constant roaring in my right ear, and I feel like I am walking on uneven ground. I have daily aches and pains that have also increased. I have noticed that even the children seem detached and faraway looking. I have never seen anything like this in my entire life. Something is blowing in the wind. We have strong gusts of wind happening right now as I type. My eyes are burning as well. Soon we will all be walking around like zombies. I already feel like I am a walking zombie, and my husband will concur that he feels the same way. Soon Jesus will come back to gather His Saints to Himself, and so shall we ever be with the Lord. foods into the diet and getting rid of white flour and sugar and a lot of red meat. I too live in KY and this unnatural tiredness has affected people around here also. Since we have been doing all this juicing and DE, Kenneth no longer takes any of his meds…none!!! He is on heart meds, BP, cholesterol, sugar pill, potassium and a water pill. He took one dose when he had to go to the doctor as he figured they would draw blood. When he came home he was so dizzy he could not walk across the floor, and he got in his recliner and could not hold his eyes open. I told him that was his proof, it was the medicine that made him old and infirm. He is 68 and has lots more energy since juicing. And his white hair is starting to turn black, he has not had black hair since he was 19. A little perk of wheatgrass

Citation: Wu, T., Armstrong, P.R., Maghirang, E.B. 2018. Vis- and NIR-based instruments for detection of black-tip damaged wheat kernels: A comparative study. Transactions of the ASABE. 61(2):461-467. https://doi.org/10.13031/trans.12432. Technical Abstract: Black-tip (BT) present in wheat kernels is a non-mycotoxic fungus that attacks the kernels wherein any of a number of molds forms a dark brown or black sooty mold at the tip of the wheat kernel. Three spectrometers covering the spectral ranges 950-1636nm (Spec1), 600-1045nm (Spec2), and 380-780nm (Spec3) were evaluated for the ability to predict the presence of black-tip. Kernels with different levels of black-tip damage (BTD) were quantified into four levels: sound (A), low (B) or high (C) black-tip symptom (BTS), and black-tip damaged (D). Discriminant classification models were developed to evaluate combinations of levels. The combinations were 1) A, B, C and D separately; 2) A, B+C, and D; and 3) A+B and C+D. The spectral data for 2,760 kernels obtained from 23 hard red winter wheat samples composing of visually selected thirty kernels for each of the four levels of black-tip severity (A, B, C, and D) were collected with each spectrometer. Discriminant calibration models for each spectrometer and classification category were developed based on (a) three combinations of 17 samples with the six remaining samples used as independent validation, and (b) combinations of 20 randomly-picked kernels from each of the 23 HRW samples as calibration samples with the remaining ten kernels used as validation samples. Discriminant analysis was based on five wavelengths for each model. Spectra pretreatment was the standard normal variate (SNV). Results showed that all three spectrometers were capable of detecting BTD on wheat kernels. BT classification accuracy was observed to have been affected by wheat varieties for Spec1 and Spec2 (both with NIR wavelengths) but not for Spec3, which was purely in the visible region. The 2-category classification (A+B, C+D) provided higher accuracy than 3-category (A, B+C, D) and 4-category classifications (A, B, C, D). Based on percent correct classification and Youden’s index, Spec2 performed better for detecting sound and BT wheat kernels with classification accuracies of the best 2-category classification calibration model ranging from 85.6 to 87.5% compared to Spec1 at 74.8 to 78.4% and Spec3 at 76.7 to 79.2%.
Week 2 of Trek Remastered gives us Devil in the Dark. Don’t expect much in terms of new space effects with Kirk and a few red shirts hunting Horta. That being said this week will mark a Trek Remastered first with some redone (and possibly animated) versions of the old matte paintings. Check our listings for your station and showime (if your local time is not there then send us a tip to add it). TrekMovie.com will have screenshots and a review up this weekend, and if you see any promos for Trek Remastered let us know. but you don’t need to wait for that to tell us what you think of Devil in the Dark Remastered. That promo does a great job not showing the Horta, which since CBS isn’t messing with the aliens, should still look like a big rubberized pile of spaghetti with meatballs. Wasn’t this episode one of the episodes Leonard Nimoy was nominated for an Emmy- his monologue while mindmelding with the Horta? Horta Hears a Who ; We are here! We are here!! In real life, during the shooting of this episode, Bill Shatner’s father passed away. Shatner cites this episode as one of the more meaningful ones to him personally, and his acting in it is very strong. And of course, Josh is right about Nimoy’s acting in this show. FYI, Nimoy was nominated for an Emmy for each of the three seasons of the original run. How he never won an award is deeply disappointing. Indeed this is an excellent episode and a favorite of mine. It is a huge shame that ST was passed up every year by the Emmy’s. I just checked Leonard Nimory was indeed nominated every year: 1967, 1968 and 1969 for Outstanding performance by an actor in a supporting role. Special effects from TOS was also nominated nearly every year and was snubbed every time. As the Horta burned it’s way into the chamber where Kirk was waiting, we can now see a more realistic ‘rock vaporizing’ effect as the Horta emerges dramatically from the tunnel it created. That was a great spot to update, it really needed it. It’s good to see this: some interior effect shots being enhanced as well. The ship shots looked fine with the planet and I really enjoyed the ending where the Enterprise flys by the camera in one long shot with the traditional ending of the Enterprise flying into the darkness. So who won special effects that year over trek? Sister Batrille? Did anyone else notice the little workers inserted in the matte painting in the office? Those are the little touches that add so much. Also, the tracking shot of the Enterprise at the end of the episode was glorious, and a first for Classic Trek, I was hoping a shot similar to this would be used to blend the two shots in the opening titles into one, the Enterprise approaches and instead of switching to a shot as it speeds away, the camera just follows as it zips by at Warp Speed. I’m really looking forward to seeing the hangar bay and Shuttlecraft Galileo on these remastered episodes. Oh hell, I love it all! im not too sure how I feel about this, I’m generally against the “remastering” of classis media just on principle. The chessy SX are part of the appeal of TOS anyway. I too thought the cruising shot of the enterprise at the end was great. i have to say i was looking forward to seeing more of the “chamber of the ages” oh well. I would like a ‘middle road’ approach to alien digital enhancements. Taking one episode as an example, after viewing the Horta in the updated clips, it seems that the original alien props, no matter how cheezy, will not be visually ‘replaced.’ I understand the reasoning behind this decision. So, instead of entering into an “totally change vs. totally keep” discussion, I have a third suggestion. Go ahead with keeping the original versions of, for example, Flint’s M-4, Nomad, the Horta, the psudeo Rastafarian Cocker Spaniel (“The Enemy Within” episode) and so on. However, do something with them; digitally add to, erase, airbrush…whatever the most laughable visual elements while retaining the prop’s overall original appearance. Returning to the Horta example, the obvious, four human limbs moving under the horta prop are what make it visually cheap. So, digitally copy and paste, say, two of those intermittently buldging parts to two, additional areas of the prop as it moves. Resulting in, for example, three moving ‘limbs’ per flank.

Each spring, the Department invites admitted students to come as a group to visit the campus to meet with faculty, learn more about the academic programs and current research, explore some of the research facilities, and spend a weekend immersed in the culture of MIT. The Department typically covers partial travel costs for students (domestic and international) to visit during these weekends. The visiting weekends will be February 28-March 3 and March 14-17, 2019. We strongly encourage admitted students to visit MIT, regardless of your initial inclination to accept or decline the offer of admission. Obviously, you will be able to make a much more well informed decision about whether MIT is right for you, after spending time with faculty, current students, and your potential classmates in the fall. Note: These weekends are intended for students admitted to the doctoral track. We will provide lodging for three nights (double occupancy) and all meals (Thursday evening through Sunday morning). You will have a great opportunity to spend a weekend with a group of people with whom you may choose to share your graduate experience. After you have been admitted, you will be asked to list a few professors with whom you would particularly like to meet on the Friday afternoon of your visit. Before the visit, we will send you additional information, including a detailed agenda of the weekend. As you begin planning your visit, please note that we ask you to arrive in Boston Thursday afternoon or evening and to depart Sunday morning. The hassles of driving around Boston and Cambridge are infamous. We recommend that you use public transportation rather than renting a car if you are coming to MIT from Logan Airport. We will be pleased to reimburse a portion of your transportation expenses to and from Boston. We will reimburse partial travel-related expenses including any or all of the following: round-trip coach class airfare, mileage at the IRS-approved reimbursement rate for up to 800 miles by car plus highway and bridge tolls; parking fees at airport or hotel; and ground transportation via taxi, shuttle, bus, or subway. As noted above, we will provide for your lodging for three nights (double occupancy) and will reimburse you a maximum of $8.00, $12.00, and $25.00 for any breakfast, lunch, or dinner (respectively) costs you incur between Thursday evening and Sunday morning. (Most of these meals will be provided.) Please keep your receipts for all out-of-pocket expenses as you must submit them for us to reimburse you. You are welcome to request a specific hotel roommate if you know another newly admitted student who will be visiting the Department the same weekend. Note: in some cases, air fare is significantly reduced if you choose to fly into nearby Providence, RI, and take public transportation to Boston.

Civil rights groups led by the Rev. Al Sharpton plan to announce an ambitious advocacy agenda Wednesday aimed at flexing their political muscle in advance of the 2016 presidential campaign. controlled Senate to confirm attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch, whose nomination process progressed and then stalled after President Obama put her name forward more than 140 days ago. level religious objections bills, seen as discriminatory against gays and lesbians, and pressing Congress to advance reforms of the criminal justice system. “We are already in the season of people announcing their run for president. We can’t wait until 2016 to set the agenda. We need to set that now,” Sharpton said Monday while visiting Washington, where he was attending meetings at the White House and with Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro. The agenda will be formalized this week at the annual convention of the National Action Network, Sharpton’s civil rights group. The meeting is the first public convening of the nation’s top civil rights leaders since a spate of police violence sparked unrest in cities across the nation, starting with the shooting of Michael Brown, 18, by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., last August. Sharpton said that he plans personally to petition Senate Republicans to hold a floor vote on Lynch’s nomination. He also plans trips to three states where religious objections laws have either been passed or are being considered. Once a skeptic of the gay rights movement, Sharpton has in recent years emerged as one of its most vocal black supporters. These days, he argues that gay rights should be considered a civil rights matter. He said bringing gay and lesbian groups into the civil rights fold is crucial to bolstering the political power of those working on civil justice issues. Such issues — gay rights and reforms in policing, criminal justice and prisons — have dominated the national discussion in recent months, opening the door for civil rights groups to claim a higher profile during the presidential campaign, some civil rights leaders say. This week’s conference will help advance that cause, they say, and help focus efforts to define the issues to be highlighted in 2016. Campbell is one of several leaders of civil rights organizations — including the heads of the NAACP and the Urban League — who plan to participate in a panel intended to chart a course, and to funnel energy from national protests in favor of policing and criminal justice reforms toward political action and achieving tangible results. “We need to be working collaboratively around how we apply elevated pressure on the candidates to talk about these issues,” Campbell said. Sharpton has been a persistent and insistent voice on behalf of reforms in policing and the criminal justice system, and this week’s convention marks the latest shift in the evolution of his tactics. Although he is a lightning rod despised by many police groups, especially the New York Police Department, Sharpton is vowing to take a more considerate line. At this week’s convention, at least three potential 2016 presidential candidates, all dark horses, will speak: Sen. Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.); former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley (D); and Maryland’s Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon and so far the only black person known to be considering a run for the GOP presidential nomination. A decade ago, it would not have been surprising for Sharpton himself to consider a presidential run. In 2004, he mounted a short-lived campaign for the Democratic nomination. He laughed off the notion that he might pursue a similar strategy in 2016.

Notes from the Beachbody Bandwagon, Part 1: The food | Wake Up, Mama! At age 45 with a 20-year career in health care, it’s crazy that I’m only now learning appropriate food portions. It’s kind of embarrassing, really, but I’m glad I finally am. It’s motivating and empowering. Beachbody is one of those multi-level marketing companies. I’m not a seller and I doubt I ever will be, but who knows? OK, without further ado, here’s how I got involved in this program and my experience so far. In this post, I’ll talk about the eating plan, and in Part 2 I’ll focus on the workouts. After baby number two, I lost all the baby weight and then some without trying. Over the next few years, I slowly and steadily packed on 30 pounds. Having never lost weight on purpose, I had no experience with how to deal with it once I realized how much weight had snuck up on me while I didn’t even have a working scale. I’ve never believed in diets, and I still believe the diet industry has caused great harm to women and girls, so a structured diet plan was not going to be my first go-to solution. I figured the weight would come off at some point without me having to do anything, as it had in the past. Maybe because I’m well into my 40’s now, vaguely stepping up my exercise and “eating healthy” only resulted in gaining another pound every couple months. I was eating clean—lots of organic produce, mostly grass-fed meat, healthy fats only, minimal starchy carbs, and almost no processed foods. I was exercising a few times a week. I didn’t see what else I could realistically do. I tried counting calories, and even using the My Fitness Pal app, I could only do it for a few days before it drove me crazy and led to obsessing over what I could and couldn’t have and when. I did the Whole30 (a paleo cleanse) a couple times. That was a worthwhile lesson on how too many grain carbs and sugar affect my energy level and moods, but I didn’t lose any weight because (I now realize) I learned nothing about how to stop overeating all that clean, healthy food. I figured all I could do was accept my new normal. I read Women, Food, and God by Geneen Roth, which I highly recommend (even though I eventually went on a “diet,” and she would probably not approve). I vowed that with practice, I would become finely tuned in to my body’s real hunger and fullness cues. I would know intuitively what foods my body needed, and how much. Mindful eating. Self-love. I was all in. I hoped the weight would naturally come off this way (pretty please?), but if not, I would fully accept my current size and learn to love my curves. Then I discovered (TMI alert!) that I couldn’t walk down the beach without this dreadful thigh chafing problem, which I found out actually has a name—“chub rub.” I also noticed there were certain yoga postures I could no longer do because I was mechanically impeded by body fat. Now it was no longer about cultivating self-acceptance and rejecting societal ideals about the female form. My weight was directly interfering with some of my favorite activities. I did the BMI calculation and it was 30. The BMI calculator isn’t perfect—it doesn’t take frame or each person’s unique proportions of fat to muscle mass into account, but I was at least in the ballpark of clinical obesity, with the attendant health risks. I was done. How did I choose this program? If not for a couple random turns of events, I probably never would have considered it because the program includes shakes. I’m not a believer in liquid meal replacements because to me, sustainable lifestyle change means being able to lose weight and keep it off by eating regular food, not to mention the fact that most nutritional shakes are full of chemical crap. I learned that a) the shakes are optional—you can do this plan on regular food only, b) a shake replaces a protein snack (and a fruit if you add that), not a full meal and c) most importantly, the ingredients in Shakeology are far superior to other shakes. I got started when a friend who is a total nutritional purist gave me about a ¼ bag of Shakeology to try. She loves the workouts, which have helped her stay consistent with exercise. Another friend (also the super granola sort) put me in touch with her coach, a like-minded person who understood and addressed my reservations around diets in general and my skepticism about any program that includes processed shake powder. I decided to try it for one cycle of the 21-Day Fix and take it from there. Is this really a “diet?” Yes and no. Yes, because you are tracking what you’re eating, portions are controlled, and if you’re following it strictly, some things are off limits. No, because it’s clean eating in healthy proportions and it can be followed indefinitely, with a little leeway certainly, as a permanent lifestyle change. The eating plan is about portion control and getting the right proportions of macronutrients—proteins, carbs and fats—so that you’re well nourished, energy levels are even and you’re not hungry, even at an overall calorie deficit. There’s no calorie counting or weighing—portions are measured using containers of different colors and sizes for each type of food: proteins, veggies, fruits, carbs (grains and starchy veggies), healthy fats, seeds and dressings, and oils/nut butters. Depending on your current weight, you get so many of each color container per day. This obviously involves tracking everything you eat in some way, so I thought it would drive me crazy the same way calories counting does. But it doesn’t, and I think there are three reasons for that. It’s not quite as fussy as counting calories. I don’t have to add or input every single ingredient. Tracking macro food groups is less involved and quicker. And the app makes it even easier. The containers make it easier to work with the question, “What do I have left for the day?” “I have a protein, a carb, 2 veggies, and a fat left.” feels a lot saner and more manageable than “I have 600 calories left, what can I eat?” (It’s also a lot easier to estimate when eating out). I’m learning portion control habits I can use for the rest of my life. I used the containers religiously for the first couple weeks. Then I started to practice eyeballing my portions by putting the food on the plate first, then putting that amount in the container to see how close I was. I’m getting really good at it. Now, when I eat out or at someone’s house, I know I’m spot on or pretty damn close. My plan was to get one 30-day supply of Shakeology as part of the package I bought, and then continue the program without it. It’s not cheap—one 30 day supply is about $120, so about $4 per shake. Some people spend that on a latte every day anyway, but I don’t. The sales pitch is, if you bought all the ingredients as superfoods and supplements, it would be many times the cost. That argument doesn’t work for me, because I’m not otherwise going to buy all that stuff, so the shakes are an extra expense, period. I wish I didn’t like Shakeology so much, because my 30-days only plan is not working out. I ordered another bag, thinking I’d have it a few times a week and make it last, but I’m still drinking it almost every day. I feel energized after my shake, and I feel great in general since I’ve started this program. The shakes are full of superfoods, so maybe that’s why. It could also be the placebo effect. Or it could be more from the workouts, or getting the right proportions of macronutrients without overeating, or some combination of two of these or all three. I started all three changes at the same time, so who knows? Whatever it is, I like the shakes, and right now I don’t feel like messing with what’s working for me. That said, I do like knowing this program is not dependent on them. If I decide to quit buying it at any time, I can replace it with a Greek yogurt or some other protein. Strict ANYTHING is not for me. That said, if I only had 5-10 pounds to lose, I might follow the 21-Day fix to the letter, get it done in one round (two, tops) and move on to maintenance. I can follow anything for three weeks. Half and half in my coffee. I tried giving this up when I did my first Whole30. Nope. I added it back after two weeks (my only cheat on that program) and I’m never

Moving food grade items from one destination to another isn’t simply a case of throwing items into the back of a truck or into a rail car and forging ahead. That’s because different products have to be assessed according to their long-term viability. Transporting bulk liquid food offers a much different set of concerns as opposed to items that may have a much different shelf life. Those responsible for either driving or shipping food grade products need to have the pertinent rules and regulations ingrained in their mind. That approach helps make simple things like hygiene and washing procedures of the trucks second nature and allows for greater peace of mind. For example, some companies neglect to keep track of the most recent deliveries within a transport vehicle. That can lead to hazards when it comes to food grade transport, especially if the previous product was a non-food item. Also, some companies claim to know all the nuances involved with Kosher food deliveries, which isn’t always the case. Food grade items can obviously be transported with any other item, yet doing so can very well compromise the quality of the items inside. That can mean that odors from the items that should not be inside or the presence of raw foods in that vicinity can bring with them potential dangers. The easiest way to avoid this type of situation is to make sure that any shipment of food grade products contains only those items. Much like the educational aspects that training is expected to cover, a clear understanding between the food processor and the transport company should be in place. All of the safeguards in world won’t do much good to protect food grade items if the mode of transportation charged with delivering them hasn’t been properly maintained. Breakdowns on the road or undetected damage inside a trailer can devastate the product, which usually ends up relegating it to the trash bin. Making sure that such regular maintenance is performed should be a basic understanding, with the transport company having properly maintained records to show such adherence. Companies that seek to save money putting off maintenance will most likely look to cut corners in other areas. During the course of any transport, regular checks on the proper temperature for certain items will help avoid disaster upon arrival at the intended destination. That’s because any breakdown or other problem that may develop can be detected quickly, with plans to address it already in place as part of a contingency plan. This is something that’s best accomplished through the use of up-to-date technology that allows for the driver to immediately tackle any problem. It also allows for a shipping company to maintain a consistent pulse on the product in question. The process of transporting bulk liquid food or any other product shouldn’t have to require a leap of faith when it comes to working with a carrier. Companies that offer reduced prices but lack any true legacy of consistent deliveries should make any business wary. Other factors that should raise red flags for those companies whose business depends on seamless bulk food grade transportation. A free flow of communication should be evident from the outset, with any questions being promptly answered. Any deviation from that approach should make it an easy decision to look elsewhere. Kan-Haul knows the ins and outs of food grade transportation, having developed their special level of expertise over the course of over three decades. So whether you’re transporting bulk liquid food, refrigerated items or need a specialized delivery, it makes a good deal of sense to contact us to handle the job.
In need of additional load testing capacity on its Axiom storage system, Oracle found that Virtual Instruments provided all the traffic and test configuration flexibility they needed to put their efficient, high capacity system to the test. Oracle’s Axiom storage product is an application-aware system, enabling multiple tiers of storage on a single platform – each with a unique level of service. It delivers an ultra-high capacity storage system which consolidates assets, modularly scales capacity, and reduces management complexity. Before deploying Virtual Instruments solutions, their test environment included racks of mid-range white boxes, switches, and tape libraries – a large complement of hardware needed to adequately stress the product before going to market. The team now needed to test both the performance and functionality, using high volume SMB and NFS traffic. Additionally, Oracle runs a virtual server farm to generate load and run test scenarios. A fleet of virtual machines would be deployed to run each test case – easy to run but hard to clean up and hard to repeat consistently. Every test case required a client and disparate application layer test suite. Limited load testing capacity. Performance is insufficient to adequately test Axiom systems. Desire greater granularity and test sophistication. Testing the unique features of the application-aware Axiom requires extremely detailed and flexible tests. Difficult, time-consuming virtual server management. Rampant VM client sprawl. Oracle discovered that WorkloadWisdom had the performance, depth, and breadth of features they were seeking. The WorkloadWisdom Workload Generator 1G series quickly enabled increase testing productivity in the Axiom storage environment. The high volume of SMB and NFS traffic is now putting realistic stress on the Oracle Axiom product with no more server of VM housekeeping headaches. Having the product’s 8 ports on different networks allows for a more representative picture of how production clients would address a storage device. Simulating connection scaling no longer requires adding in sets of client, which had been impossible before with their VM client set up. Oracle has easy access to stats that were only available via network traces and client OS data. And they get real-time results as part of the scenario instead of requiring extra triage cycles. Even customer log scenarios are easily reverse engineered for targeted tests. With WorkloadWisdom, Oracle performs tests that exceed the demands their customers put on the Axiom system. And they can do it with greater control, in less time, and using fewer resources. The Workload Generator 1G series is a high-performance load-generating system designed for comprehensive storage network testing. More than a simple load generator, the system provides protocol-level control and semantic definition that enables the broadest possible range of test cases. The product features 8 singly configurable 1G ports and an additional 1G management port. It supports multiple authentication types and originates both NFS and CIFS traffic, simulating a great number of clients and scenarios at once. It easily handles multiple scenarios with varying lists of commands within each of 5 protocols (CIFS v1, v2, and NFS v2, v3, v4) — all running at the same time without operational overhead. The WorkloadWisdom product is the clear choice for companies in the storage industry, because Virtual Instruments knows storage better than any other test tool vendor. It is the industry’s elite testing tool due to the product focus on storage-specific features; high-volume traffic handling, customer-centric graphic interface, and prebuilt tests and wizards. Unparalleled load testing. Can validate the extreme performance of the Axiom. Comprehensive, flexible tests. Able to fully test the features that make the Pillar Axiom unique. No virtual machine sprawl. One appliance replaced all of the virtual machine clients, and more. Time savings in executing multiple test suites. Single-screen, graphical control of test tools enables fast settings changes. Ease of test case creation and control at the protocol level. Granular visibility and results are available for individual components. Consistent, repeatable results. Test clean-up is automatic. Start tests at the same point with a clean slate.
I rarely make muffins at home and never order one when I’m out and about as I find they’re often far too sweet and never truly that satisfying. I realize, too, in looking back at my cookbook that there’s only one muffin recipe throughout. Case in point: I’m tentative on muffins. But not these. We’ve been pretty thrilled to have this healthier version of Morning Glory muffins on the counter this week; they have little bits of apple, raisins, walnuts, and grated carrot and are cloaked in a buttery oat crumble topping — quite the opposite of your boring coffeeshop fare. I thought long and hard about doing a Valentine’s post, some festive cookie or confection that would be share-worthy this weekend, but the more we talked about what our weekend would really look like, it involved something special for breakfast instead. I don’t remember the last time a Valentine’s Day fell on a Saturday, so we have big plans to have breakfast in bed and if your plans are even remotely similar, these muffins would be a fine inclusion. I remember when Sam and I were first dating long distance, and occasions or holidays would feel like a hurdle: I’d so wish we could be together and fell into the trap of constantly thinking towards the next birthday or the next Valentine’s Day and assuring myself it’d be different the following year — envisioning the grand places where we might celebrate (if we were in San Francisco maybe at Zuni to share the famous chicken and a few oysters; if in Seattle, perhaps Spinasse for a plate of that simple, buttery pasta). The funny thing: now that that period in our lives is over, I think much less eagerly towards grand dates or sweeping gestures, and look forward to the smaller dates and moments. Sam asked last night if we should think about going out to dinner on Saturday and we both glanced at each other with the same look in our eye: I hope the other says no; let’s stay in. This is not to say that we don’t love going out because we love trying new cafes around town and visiting our favorite neighborhood spot, but there’s something almost more special about planning the quieter moments — figuring out what kind of pancakes we’ll make and how to balance the coffee on the bed without spilling it, making homemade whipped cream, catching up on the week. I have a quote taped to the computer in my office at Marge; it’s an Annie Dillard quote that reads “How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.” It’s possible I’ve shared this quote here before, but I can’t remember and maybe it’s a good one to revisit regardless. Instead of inspirational photos of people and places, this alone serves as a good reminder when I start to feel overwhelmed by all of the Bigger Things in life (success of a business, taxes, celebrating holidays and occasions). While fancy dates and dinners are nice, it’s really the everyday meals (and occasional breakfast in bed) that comprise most of our life — and when focusing too much on the grand and fancy, you lose sight of most of the really good stuff. Like muffins in bed. I hope you have some this weekend, solo or joined by someone you love. Megan’s Note: I know the ingredient list for these muffins looks long, but a handful are spices alone and I imagine a few are things you already have in your pantry. I know some of you are hesitant about coconut oil, but it really is so wonderful in these muffins; it has a sweet fragrance that adds so much. If you don’t have it or would rather not use it, I imagine that butter would work just fine as well. I haven’t tested these with butter, but I can’t think of any clear reason why they’d be negatively affected (if you try it, let me know!) The one thing to remember about the oil: do make sure it isn’t very hot when adding it to the wet ingredients as you don’t want to curdle your yogurt and milk — I let mine cool to almost room temperature while still making sure it’s in its liquid state. My best advice for these muffins is not to be conservative with the crumble topping; as the muffin tops spread in the oven you’re going to wish you had more of it, so feel free to really layer and even lightly press it onto each. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the two flours, oats, sugar, baking powder and baking soda, spices and salt. In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs, applesauce, yogurt, milk, coconut oil and vanilla extract. Fold in orange zest, apple, carrots, raisins and walnuts. Scoop batter into 12 paper-lined muffin tins, filling each almost to the top. Spoon crumble filling on top. Bake for 25-27 minutes, or until muffins are golden brown around the edges and feel firm to the touch, even in the center. Let cool in the tin for 10 minutes. Muffins will keep for 2 days if stored covered at room temperature. These look scrumptious!If I replace the whole wheat and all purpose flour with a gluten free all purpose flour do you think they'd turn out the same? Or use all oat flour maybe? Would love to try them but can't have gluten. Your morning glory muffins look like such a delight. Definitely need to try these! These look fantastic! Our house is filled with smiles and cheers when I bake your pear and hazelnut muffins...look forward to baking these beauties this weekend :) Thanks for sharing! I'm running home to bake these, pronto. I'm not normally big on muffins either - and I'd definitely eat them as a snack rather than breakfast - but these look so good. I love the little apple-y chunks and the ingredient list is so wholesome. I love your breakfast muffins, along with every other recipe in your cookbook. I have fun experimenting with the mix-ins. Can't wait to make these! Recipes like this really help me add variety to breakfast and snack time. Morning glory muffins are my go-to, and my recipe is remarkably similar BUT! I've never tried a crumble topping! Kills a bit of the health factor but my guess is that it's well worth it. I'll try it out and see! love the crumble topping! such a good idea. I think these might be added to the weekend "To Make" list. They will be my sustenance in between shoveling another mountain of snow here in Boston... oy. Crumble toppings: I can't get enough! Thanks for the recipe, Megan! Happy weekend to you and Sam! Made them on Sunday and they were SPECTACULAR! I used Bob's Red Mill gluten free cup for cup flour and the texture was perfect. Just the right amount of sweetness, crunch, and I love how moist they turned out. I'll be doubling the next batch for sure! Hello! I've been reading your blog for almost a year now but haven't yet commented before. I'm not sure why, but today, I finally decided that I need to as I love your posts. I truly get excited when they come out - how you write and the recipes you post are always unique and very special. Thanks for another great one today - these look delicious! My husband and I love our weekend morning rituals, and when we are having a particularly grueling work week, we often celebrate the weekend morning by staying in bed for a couple of hours, drinking coffee or tea and watching the cooking channel. Bliss. These look like lovely muffins with the perfect amount of spice. They would go so well with our weekend coffee or tea. These will be perfect for our family weekend brunch! Yum! What a wonderful post. I often forget how wonderful life's everyday moments are until I see pictures of my kids goofing off and think...tomorrow, I'm really going to pay attention. The muffins look like Saturday morning to me! This is my second time making these muffins. First, they were a hit at a baby shower and tomorrow I'm bringing them for a birthday brunch at work. They are definitely labor intensive on the front end, but SO DELICIOUS! Yes, the ingredient list is long, but most of it is pantry staples (for me, at least)! I used a tablespoon of orange marmalade because I didn't have any oranges for the zest and I pureed an apple with a little apple juice because I didn't have applesauce. The muffins turned out beautifully and my family made them disappear in record time. This recipe is absolutely a keeper!
Belieber or not, Oxygen x Bieber Collection has captured the eyes and hearts of Manila's fashion populace. The limited edition #OxygenxBieber Collection is composed of cool graphic tees, pullover, bomber jackets, caps and hoodies that take heavy inspiration from the pop star himself and his hit album, Purpose. The Oxygen x Bieber Collection is a licensed merchandise in partnership with Bravado and MCAA Universal. I got a special invite to the VIP Shopping Party (thank you to our friends from ARC PR) at the Oxygen Popup Store in SM Mega Fashion Hall. There were over 20 pieces for men and women and it was not an easy task to pick just the pieces I could really wear. "As a rand that is inspired by both streetwear and music, we believe that Justin Bieber would be the perfect partner for this collection as he is globally known for his music and his fondness for streetwear. He constantly reinvent himself, just like how Oxygen continues to evolve in he fashion to keep up with the youth's edgy but relaxed style". Oxygen Brand Director, Jeff Bascon. I got myself some really cool shirts. I always love rock band shirts and icon shirts, and I felt that Justin Bieber deserves to be part of my holy chic collection. Some of the shirts have prints of the titles of his songs from the album, Purpose like "What Do You Mean?", "Sorry" and "Love Your Self". I am a Belieber and his song "Sorry" somehow takes me back to my Harry Potter Themed Party (I don't know why - probably because during our meeting, I requested the team to play "now" songs during breaks like Justin Bieber - Sorry - and they did. They kept playing that song during my party! Haha). Love the #OxygenxBieber Collection! Simply pair these pieces with classics that you have in your wardrobe to add some funk and edginess on your style.

It has been a while since I wrote anything about my cycling, and there has been quite a bit of it recently, including a couple of sportives. First up was the inaugural Ride With Brad sportive in and around Lancashire/North Yorkshire. Whilst it has a new name and a new patron, the event has been run previously and went by the name of the Bowland Beast, or Pendle Pedal. It was my first time riding oop North. The course was tough by any standard. Comprising 100 miles and over 3000m of climbing including Longridge Fell, Trough of Bowland, Nick ‘O Pendle, Barley Fell and lots more un-named but brutal hills. The last 20km or so in-particular was constantly up and down over gradients in the mid-teens. I started off in the third wave of riders and we made quick progress for the first 13 miles to the bottom of Longridge Fell. The weather was perfect at this stage with no wind and a mild temperature. At the 50 mile food stop I was feeling fine and continued on after a quick stop. Unfortunately just after a group of us took a slight diversion off the intended route and this must be where Wiggins himself managed to pass us by. Loads of people talked about getting to ride with him for a while, but we must have missed him here. For the final half the weather also turned a bit. Thankfully there was still no wind, but a constant drizzle descended for the rest of the ride. The only real impact was to make people a bit more cautious on descents, but still there were a couple of incidents I came across. I also started cramping up on climbs. I had to stop briefly at one point to shake my legs out and started to make sure I fed and watered more regularly than I had been doing. However the damage was done. Thankfully however I was still making up the severe climbs using a variety of positions on the bike to try to use different muscle groups. By this stage there were plently of people walking the hills! Only on the steep ascent out of Barley did I run into trouble as my right leg completely cramped up on a 17% gradient and I had to unclip or fall over. There was no way of getting back on and going so I had to walk the final 20m of the climb. Once the ride was completed there was time to stick around to watch Brad do the raffle before heading back down the motorways. All in all it was a well run event and certainly a good challenge. Two weeks after the Ride With Brad was another new sportive, but this time a lot closer to home, and a lot flatter! The Red Kite Ride was put on by Marlow Riders and took a 100 mile route North through the Chilterns and Vale of Aylesbury. The route was fairly flat with only 1200m of climbing. Once again I started amongst the first riders and managed to spend the majority of the first half in the company of a group of 4-5 others. We worked quite well together keeping up a good pace along some fast roads. The second half was spent pretty much solo but again I pushed on in an attempt to keep a decent average speed up. The effort from the Ride With Brad had obviously paid dividends as I felt pretty strong. I also fuelled better. Talking of which, Marlow Riders really went to town with the food stops which were the best stocked I have ever seen! I made it back to the base in a pleasing sub 6 hour moving time at an average speed of just over 17mph. By contrast that is 90 minutes quicker than my moving time for the Ride With Brad over basically the same distance! Just goes to show that I’m definitely not a climber! As I’ve previously blogged about one of my cycling goals for this year is to try my hand at time trialling. Whilst I couldn’t make the first few club TT events I finally managed to get out a couple of weeks ago on a very wet Tuesday evening for my first ever 10 mile TT. The weather had been pretty awful all day with a lot of rain and therefore standing water on the roads, however the forecast showed the rain stopping about 7pm so I made my way up to the start a couple of miles North of Codicote. As a first outing this was all about just getting used to the procedures and getting a basic idea of my TT ability. The only goal I’d set myself for the year was to get under 30 minutes, or in other words a 20mph average. There was a small turnout of 13 people and I set off first as I figured I’d probably be the slowest. Due to the wet weather the start was moved a couple of hundred yards up the road so technically this wasn’t a full race. However I managed an official time of 30 minutes and 37 seconds so not far off my initial goal. I got a poor start as I basically let the starter push me off rather than using any of my own effort. I was also hesistant at the first turn onto the main road, not trusting the marshall telling me all was clear and not using the width of the road to get a good line. However, after the start it was a case of just pushing as hard as I could all the way to the turn and back. As you can see from the Strava data, the course is basically more downhill on the way out with a couple of short climbs, then the reverse on the way back with more longer drags. Whilst it is still basically flat the second half is definitely harder and you need to save something for a good finish. I spent most of the time in the drops but did find myself coming up onto the hoods a few times for a breather, and also dropping into a lower gear than I probably should have been in. I was passed by three riders before the end. By the end though I was shattered. Crossing the line I struggled to call out my number to the time keepers and could feel a distinct wheezy chest feeling that I hadn’t had since my asthma disappeared about 15 years ago. To be honest I had quite an uncomfortable night’s sleep following it and couldn’t breathe fully and deeply for a couple of days as my lungs recovered from the effort. This took me a bit by surprise. Despite this however I was soon thinking about how I could improve (start, turns, more aero, more pain tolerance) next time, and so it was I headed back up this week. With the much better weather (but the same 10mph or so headwind on the way out) there were many more people turning out and I found myself going off in twentieth place. This time we were starting from the normal point, so there was more chance to build up speed before turning left onto the main road. This time around I got a much better start and turn and then it was just a case of measuring my effort on the first half in the knowledge that I had to keep something in reserve. At the turn my Garmin was showing an average of above 22mph so I knew I was going well and on course for a sub-30 minute time. I’d also stayed in the drops all the way, and in fact only came out of them once on the penultimate drag on the way back. On the final hill up to the turn-off before the finish I pushed about as hard as I have ever done on the bike to keep my speed up and on crossing the line could see that my average was still above 20mph. I cycled slowly back to the finish line, catching my breath, and checked in with the time keepers to find I’d done 29.11! Well over a minute faster than my first time out. What’s more I recovered much quicker and had a very decent night’s sleep! It is a bit early to say that I’ve got the TT bug, but I’ll definitely be heading out more times over the summer. However now the 30 minute goal has been achieved I’m not setting any other goal other than to feel that I’ve tried as hard or harder each time and feel myself getting better. Times will not come down forever and conditions on each day will always play a part anyway. Now it is just about learning to enjoy the pain!
Zheng Er goes to talk with Tai Bu and the Queen. They ask her if she really loves Si Ye. She says yes, but he is in love with Xue Wu. She doesn’t feel as if she has a chance. Tai Bu gives her a pouch amulet and says that if she puts this under Xue Wu’s bed, then Si Ye will stop loving Xue Wu and love Zheng Er. They tell her that they will give Zhen Er the opportunity, all she has to do is wait. They give her a hairpin and tell her that they want the best for her. The next day, Zheng Er Xue Wu takes Zheng Er’s hands and tells Zheng Er that Zheng Er will be the one who will be Si Ye’s wife in this competition. He usually cares more for others and not for himself. You have to watch out for him. He’s been on his own since he was six and he’s a very lonely person. So in the future, please be by his side as much as you can. After the wedding, if you could take him away from the problems of the palace. If you can take him to live in the mountains then that would be great, because his greatest wish is to live peacefully. My greatest wish is that you will replace me in taking care of him. I know you will be better than me, because I know you will be much better than I for him. Si Ye is about to leave after addressing Zheng Er’s Wound. Zheng Er asks if Si Ye can stay for her. Si Ye has to let her down and says he has to go back. She asks “Do you really dislike me that much? Si Ye asks, “Do you know what “to like” means? Even a few hours feel like years when I don’t see her.” Zheng asks if he means Xue Wu? Zheng Er asks if its because she can’t compare well to Xue Wu ? Si Ye says no, “No! No! It’s her that can’t compare well to you. She’s not as polite as you, not as well versed in customs, not as refined. But… it is her shadow that’s imprinted on my heart. It’s her that I dream about at night. When I wake up I want to see her. I want her to call me Si Ye, I want her to argue and fight with me. I have no idea how to handle her sometimes. Why did I fall in love with this kind… this kind of girl that I can’t control? I have no idea. But I’m sorry, I only love her. Zheng Er asks if he’ll really disobey imperial edict for Si Ye. He says yes, he has handled the Wife Choosing competition but he won’t marry. If he marries anyone, it would not be fair to that person and it wouldn’t be fair to Xue Wu. Zheng Er is stunned. News arrives that Xue Wu has been drugged and kidnapped from the village. Si Ye rushes away. Zheng Er realizes that this is the opportunity and slips away to put the pouch amulet in Xue Wu’s room. Meanwhile grandmother is looking into the future and realizes that people are trying to kill Xue Wu and Si Ye. She tells Xiao Dong that Xue Wu needs to leave now. Si Ye and An De Wang tracks down the kidnapper, who tells them that there is gold for Xue Wu’s life. Si Ye kills the assassin in rage and takes Xue Wu back, getting injured in the process. They go back and Si Ye tells everyone not to mention the even to the still drugged Xue Wu. Xue Wu wakes up as Si Ye sits by her. She grabs her head in pain and asks what happened. Si Ye lies and said that she drank wine instead of water and then she fell asleep. She says he’s lying! He looks stunned and she continues to say, “ Whenever I drink I do stupid things, I never just fall asleep. So what did I do?” Si Ye says that she just slapped him, she didn’t say anything. She smiles in relief and mock punches him in the side (where he was injured by the assassin) and he doubles over in pain. She asks what’s wrong and he lies that he was injured while practicing with his sword. Si Ye leaves. Xiao Dong comes in and tells Xue Wu that they have to leave, her grandmother wants her to leave now. Si Ye and An De Wang realizes that the Crown Prince and his faction are the ones behind the assassination. Si Ye says that he’s scare that he can’t look at Xue Wu’s safety objectively. He wonders if it’s the correct choice to let Xue Wu leave. Tai Bu hears from Zheng Er that the pouch has been put in Xue Wu’s bed. They proceed with the plan. Xue Wu has prepared the things and Xiao Dong asks if they should go say goodbye to Si Ye. Xue Wu replies that if she sees Si Ye then she’ll never leave. They get to the gate and Xue Wu looks back at the house, crying. Xiao Dong opens the door to find Si Ye. Si Ye walks to Xue Wu and asks why is she leaving without saying goodbye. She’s crying as she says that she can’t leave if she went to find him. He says that once he had told her that he never really had anything to call his own. Her leaving now leaves him with nothing again. She cries harder and tells him not to say that. She has to leave he knows that she doesn’t belong here. He says that perhaps its for the best. He probably is fated to belong to someone else, tomorrow is the last day of the Wife Choosing Competition. He probably has to choose Zheng Er. He tells her that she doesn’t have to be burdened by their marriage. She can see it as a act, from now on she and him will not be connected. She tells him live well in a small voice. He stands behind her and slips the jade pendant in her bag. She nods, and leaves. In the carriage she finds the pendant and starts crying. An De Wang asks why, and Si Ye replies, “Xue Wu at my side, its too dangerous for her. The next day, Tai Bu goes to the king and tells him that Si Ye is going to revolt against him. Si Ye has even hired a Shaman to perform spells to weaken the king’s power. Since the shaman is dead, the only evidence against Si Ye is that the Shaman had left an amulet in Si Ye’s house. The king is angered and tells Tai Bu to go and find the evidence. They find the yellow amulet pouch in Xue Wu’s room, and bring Si Ye to the king. Tai Bu says that this is the evil amulet, and that Si Ye wants to become king. Tai Bu says that Xue Wu is a witch who had been using spells that caused the King the chronic headaches. Since Xue Wu is gone and no one can explain the amulet pouch. The King orders Si Ye to be imprisoned and executed on treason and witchcraft. Zheng Er accuses Tai Bu of tricking her and making up the whole thing. She wants to tell the king about Tai Bu and the Queen’s evil plot but Tai Bu causes her to faint. Now he has the only person who can prove Si Ye is innocent. I couldn’t care more or less for the evil people in this show. Mainly because they are as about effective as overcooked noodles. I can’t spend more than five seconds on the evil people when the main characters are still in the throes of self doubt and betting against each other. Xue Wu’s unwavering belief that she is not the ONE and Si Ye’s noble idiocy are enough to deal with in one episode. Though I have to admit. The goodbye is effective. I felt the love between the two in that one scene. Usually I follow the story but FSF’s gaze as Xue Wu walks out of his life speaks louder than if he had screamed “Don’t Go!”. As for the whole treason plot, I’m just glad it gets resolved in the next episodes. Ugh, I’m really hating Xue Wu’s character. I feel like slapping her a billion times each episode. I hate noble idiocy and I hate her stupid denial. Maybe the reason SY marries that Zhen girl because XW has given up on him. Don’t blame everything on a stupid prophecy when you yourself don’t have enough confidence and self-esteem to marry the guy. Ugh. I’m seriously considering dropping this because once a noble idiot/stupid character, always a noble idiot.
We are the leading European NGO specialising in growing agriculture, protecting the environment and developing businesses in rural Africa. The World Bank estimates that growth in the agricultural sector is two and a half times more effective at reducing poverty than growth in other sectors. By ensuring farmers have the right tools, seeds and techniques, we help them double or even treble their yields – ending their reliance on food aid and helping them to become self-sufficient. By building links to markets, we help them sell their surplus – so they can afford to send their children to school and reinvest in their land. By training them how to add more value to their produce, we help them build businesses and become rural entrepreneurs – bringing major social and economic benefits to the entire community, country and continent. Farm Africa tests new technologies and trains farmers in them. Success breeds success and once trained farmers pass on their new know-how to others, ensuring our work has an impact well beyond our projects. Our approach is to spread tried-and-tested methods as widely as possible. Although eastern Africa is widely varied in its landscapes and peoples, there are many common farming problems everyone faces. Farm Africa shares knowledge across communities, without the constraint of country borders.We increasingly work on regional projects that are for more than one country.

Verified September 2016 by PD Sander Dijkstra, MD PhD, Leiden University Medical Center. Rationale: Bone metastases arise in 50% of all patients dying of cancer, increasing up to 70% in patients with breast and prostate cancer. The lesions can cause pain and fractures, leading to diminished quality of life and poorer survival. Current knowledge concerning adequate, personalized treatment of metastatic lesions of the long bones in patients with disseminated cancer is insufficient and inconclusive due to lack of large, prospective series with patient reported outcome measures. One of the debatable issues is the effectiveness of postoperative radiotherapy. It has become common practise due to professional opinion, but research evidence is lacking. It is thought that adjuvant radiotherapy improves the durability of an implant, prevents progression of the lesion, promotes bone healing, improves limb function, minimises pain and reduces the need for reoperations, however none of these are certain. Moreover, it is a burden on patient's quality of life (e.g. multiple extra hospital visits) causing toxicity and possible side effects (e.g. skin irritation). The true beneficial effect, weighing up the possible pros and certain cons, of adjuvant radiotherapy is thus unknown. Objective: The PORT study aims to demonstrate the non-inferiority of 'surgery only' compared to surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy as treatment of impending and actual pathological fractures on the pain experienced by patients. Study design: A multicentre, prospective, randomised non-inferiority trial nested within the OPTIMAL study. Study population: All patients with metastases of the long bones undergoing surgery for a(n) (impending) pathologic fracture in the participating centres. Study intervention: One study arm (A) will receive surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy; the other study arm (B) will receive surgery only. Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary endpoint is patient reported pain according to a numeric rating scale (NRS). Clinical functioning, radiological status, complications and survival are secondary endpoints. Pain will measured before treatment and after treatment on an 11-point numeric rating scale for pain. If the score differs more than 2 points between those measuring moments the change in pain is reported as significant. The number of patients in each group with a significant change in pain score will be measured.
I’ve long predicted that this shift would occur. Gay marriage now seems to have majority support, or close to it, with growth in that support accelerating over time. (A model designed by Nate Silver a couple of years back predicted that even a majority of Kansans won’t back a ban in 2015.) I still think that in a generation the Right will try to obscure the fact that it ever opposed Don’t-Ask-Don’t-Tell. Thoughts? Has conservative elites’ discomfort with the issue become a widely-discussed trend? Has such discomfort been talked about in religious Right circles? Has there been violent pushback? I wonder whether some of this could be due to opinions about what makes social change legitimate. Some on the right are more vehemently opposed to the advancement of gay rights by judicial decree than by legislative action or initiative, particularly insofar as the latter is more likely to reflect changes in public opinion. It’s often easier to handle losing a policy fight if one feels it was “fair” — e.g. that there was open debate and the democratic process worked, etc. — than if it was imposed by judges. Further, so long as gay rights advanced more in the courts than in legislatures, social conservatives could convince themselves that they represented a “silent majority” of people who feel like they do, but this position is far harder to maintain when the same policies are adopted by elected representatives (as when Congress got rid of DADT). Just a thought. Iâ€™ve long predicted that this shift would occur. I wish I could agree with you. But I think you are guilty of projecting Enlightenment values on Talibanic minds. Enlightenment folk care a lot about process; Talibs care only about outcomes. If there are some Enlightenment homophobes around, they might be willing to lose if they think that the process is fair. But “Enlightenment homophobe” has become an oxymoron the last few years. What’s left is people who only care about winning, fair or foul, with some preference for foulness because is it manlier. I’m really surprised that social conservatives are willing to concede the gay issue. Did they say why they are giving up the fight or why they think it is a “losing issue for social conservatives”? The fact that gay marriages are occurring (and between ordinary-looking people) and are not threatening heterosexual marriages may have taken the force out of the only “argument” that the opponents of gay marriage ever offered. Benny: They didn’t elaborate, but I assume that they read the same polls I do. Public opinion is unfavorable to them on this and is getting less favorable by the month. koreyel: I’m not sure that social conservatives have a hot new idea. They did seem to think, plausibly, that abortion still has some force as an issue–as represents a kind of justice, since there’s at least an argument to be joined there, whereas opposition to gay rights is essentially just “ick factor.” And there are some signs that young people are less pro-choice on abortion than the generation just above them–not radically, but enough to make conservatives think the cause isn’t lost. Brett, can you offer me some kind of explanation for the Ninth Amendment. What does it mean to people like you? Just speculating here, but social conservative elites may be plotting on a five year timeline, while Pawlenty’s fate will likely be decided in 10 months, and that difference drives outcomes. It could also be a matter of which conservatives you’re talking to. South Carolina and Iowa are pretty religious (although Pawlenty may have decided to write off Iowa). That anything which was understood to be a right at the time the 9th amendment was ratified, but which happened to not be mentioned in the Bill of Rights, is none the less protected. I don’t believe it was a license for the courts to invent new rights. Huh. Can you name some of those rights, the ones that are protected but are not in the Bill of Rights? Abortion … was legal in the United States from the time the earliest settlers arrived. At the time the Constitution was adopted, abortions before “quickening” were openly advertised and commonly performed. In the mid-to-late 1800s states began passing laws that made abortion illegal. There were few laws on abortion in the United States at the time of independence, except the English common law adopted into United States law by Acts of Reception, which held abortion to be legally acceptable if occurring before quickening. … Various anti-abortion statutes began to appear in the 1820s. Whatâ€™s that got to do with living constitutionalists, though? For the purpose of this conversation, I don’t think it has anything to do with them. I wasn’t curious about living constitutionalists – I know, roughly speaking, what they think. I was wondering about the originalists or strict constructionists or whatever. How do they ignore the actual words of the Constitution, or the clear intent behind those words? A simpler explanation for the effect that Jonathan Adler notes: right-wing extremists will want to deprive a minority of equal rights as long as they can get away with it in terms of public opinion; when public sentiment turns and it’s no longer (a) politically useful and (b) politically possible to pick on the minority, they stop. pfootball, when you cut them off like that, there’s no amusement value remaining. Minnesota just put gay rights denial on the ballot. That doesn’t seem to square with ending anti-gay issue mongering. Why, in much the same manor as you beat your wife, (Or maybe husband…) I would presume. I see this argument advanced a lot, but I’ve never seen proof of it. I don’t recall much in the way of right-wingers condemning a court decision which favored *them*. Sorry, Dan Staley. I didn’t think Brett would fold so quickly, and I didn’t mean to deprive you of amusement. There comes before us, now and then, a case whose proper outcome is so clearly indicated by tradition and common sense, that its decision ought to shape the law, rather than vice versa. That there is a bracing dose of conservative intellectualism. You ARE aware, aren’t you, that Scalia vehemently denies being a “strict constructionist”? Pardon, Brett. Please substitute “originalism” for “strict constructionism.” Right-wing pathology ain’t my bag, and I can’t get you to explain it to me. Ooh. I’ve got a new vocabulary word: “Textualism”. Commentators seem to differ on whether Justice Thomas, who signed the Scalia opinion, is a “strict constructionist,” but there seems to be general agreement that he’s a textualist. Interesting stuff, this conservative intellectualism. I don’t suppose you heard a single speaker say anything like this, Andrew?

Back in the late 1990s, in my post-college, early New York City days, I was obsessed with a sci-fi / crime TV series called The Pretender. The conceit, though contrived, drew me in: an underground organization had kidnapped a child genius with the prodigious ability to impersonate anyone, and used his powers for their own evildoings. He finally escaped, and spent his adult years both hiding from his captors and using his powers for good rather than for evil. Imagine Quantum Leap without the time travel and the gender-bending. It was fascinating to watch the "Pretender" himself, Jarod, do a bit of research - read a manual, surf some websites, examine some diagrams - and then perform surgery, fix a car, fly a plane, whatever, as he took on any number of identities and professions, all while pursuing his real parents, discovering his past, and fighting injustices along the way, disappearing as quickly as he'd arrived. He was the perfect superhero. He was everybody. And therefore, he was nobody. It's a dream role for an actor: to lose yourself in a character who loses himself in infinite identities. Who am I this time? As an actor, you have to be able to do almost anything that gets thrown your way. Can I rollerskate? Of course I can rollerskate. Speak in a Persian accent. Bawk like a chicken. Kiss. Kill. But good actors who can't get acting work too often waste their impersonating skills on a number of mindless jobs that are merely meant to fill the gaps: bartender, server, sales clerk, maybe copyeditor, housepainter, even real estate agent or cook. One job allows them to bide time until they get the other. Although I've been an aspiring actor since childhood, I've refused to go the bartender route. I've refused to go camping in the woods in the rain for some NYU student film I'm not getting paid for. I've refused to be a starving artist. Instead, I've lived my life as an actor, taking on wildly different roles, improvising my way through unpredictable situations, impersonating the people I'm supposed to be. Am I a classical music expert? No. Can I sell classical music to the casually curious as a trusted authority? Yes. Am I an attorney? No. Can I sue you, get a judgment in my favor, and collect the money I'm owed? Yes. Draft, redline, and negotiate the best possible contract? Definitely. Was I trained to do so?...Not exactly. But I have observed. I've read. I've studied people and their behaviors. I've adopted their language. I know what it means. Of course I can rollerskate. This makes my day job resume somewhat confusing to recruiters and potential employers. In a time of specialization, I am a generalist. I can both strategize and execute. I can both create and budget. I can sell sponsorships and services and products. I am digital and physical. Theoretical and tactical. A full-course dinner. Sometimes I am reticent to take on a job because I don't actually know (yet) how to do it. I don't like to play a game I can't win; I don't like to respond to a question unless I'm certain of a correct answer. But as an actor, you have to be willing to take risks. You have to be willing to just try it. Just try something. As a pleasant surprise, almost everything I've tried, at least professionally, has worked. And now I know how to be a meeting facilitator, professionally and officially. I realized I'd very much held that role informally in nearly every meeting I'd ever attended throughout my career - speaking on behalf of the impartial, common goal rather than of my own needs - but its value had never before been acknowledged. Until now, it had never been deemed necessary. I'd never been compensated for it specifically. When you're acting, there's a moment when the cameras are off, when production has wrapped, when picture has locked, that your job is done. The role is over. You have to go back to being yourself. But when one of my contracts ends, the project completed, the job done, there's nothing for me to go back to. Only on to the next thing. On The Pretender, Jarod would always say, "I don't know who I am." He wasn't running away from himself; he was looking for himself. I think I know who I am. I think I know all these things I am so far, the personalities and job titles and functionalities and capabilities and talents and interests and adventures and exploits that I've mortared together in some crazy folk art mosaic castle of myself. I just don't know who I'm not. Who will I never be? And when will it stop?

The good news is that whether you love to dyno already or you’ve never popped for a hold in your life (yet), SAID rules in training power just like it does for all other climbing training aspects (please try not to get bored with SAID – I’m going to keep beating you over the head with it for a while longer). This means that if you want to challenge your current power level, you need to push it higher by training specifically to this end. Can you do this with weights? Yes…well, sort of. Strength training, which I discussed in WI 8, will definitely yield a gain in your power potential and is a cornerstone of improving your power. Another great and succinct statement from the same Naturally Intense blog entry quoted yesterday says simply, “…you can be strong and not powerful but you can’t be powerful without a certain base of strength as the two are very directly related.” This is why it can be so very helpful to regularly spend a chunk of time training strength in your areas of weaknesses with weights or other resistance methods – because if you have little, no, or simply not enough of a strength base to build upon for the moves you want to perform, trying to build power on those moves can be a painstakingly slow and ineffective/inefficient process, potentially leading to overtraining, injury or burnout. (Read “The Importance of Strength for Enhanced Explosiveness” for more on how strength training contributes to your ability to generate power). But let’s say you already do have the strength base for the moves/level of climbing you’re attempting, whether from a smart resistance training program or from climbing or from a bit of both. When you’re aiming to build power, one option is to transition to using lighter weights than your strength-training levels and attempt to “dyno” the weights, or move them more explosively, optimally in climbing-relevant motions. Campus boards can help with training this type of motion, too, but only if you’re strong enough to campus correctly without getting hurt – and they may help you develop better timing and contact strength while also teaching you to recruit and deliver explosive power. And plyometric workouts for legs can help you strengthen and get used to the prospect of using your legs to help generate explosive movements in climbing as well. However, though I’ve experimented with all of these outside-of-climbing power-training methods, I’ve come to believe that at least for me, alongside training with weights to build my strength up, that the majority of my time is more efficiently and effectively spent by training this strength-related skill (power) in a direct climbing context – both by repetitively practicing dynamic and power-sapping moves and sequences of moves, as well as deliberately moving through difficult climbing sequences more quickly and explosively, both in the gym and on real rock.
Over 60 million people visit Georgia each year, for business, leisure and tourism. In southeastern Georgia, the Atlantic Ocean attracts throngs of beach-goers each summer. The low-lying southern parts of the state are fringed with swamps, including the massive Okefenokee. The terrain gently rises to the north and west, and the state’s principal city, Atlanta, sits just to the south of the Appalachian and Blue Ridge Mountains. These mountains rise to over 4,000 feet, drawing hikers, climbers and other outdoor enthusiasts. Georgia’s relatively significant size and diverse topography mean that the climate varies in different parts of the state. Georgia falls into the same climate classification category, humid subtropical, as most of the southeastern United States. This climate type features mild winters, comfortable spring and autumn temperatures, but long, hot and steamy summers. As its name implies, high humidity characterizes the humid subtropical climate type, which makes temperatures feel even warmer. Precipitation amounts vary annually but tend to be substantial, ranging from an average of 50 inches in the southern lowlands to 75 inches in the mountains. The northern mountains, particularly the higher elevations, experience the coldest average temperatures in the state, while the far south has the overall highest temperatures. Most of Georgia becomes sweltering in the summertime, as tropical air streams into the state unabated. The high temperature in the hottest months of the year, July and August, average in the low 90s Fahrenheit in the south and coastal areas, the upper 80s to near 90 in the Atlanta vicinity and the mid to upper 80s in the mountains. Overnight lows average in the low 70s in the south and on the coast, near 70 in Atlanta, and the 60s in the mountains. Occasional thunderstorms provide the bulk of summer rainfall, except for precipitation from tropical storms and hurricanes in late summer. Such systems occasionally directly strike Georgia’s Atlantic coast, but more often their remnants track into the state from Alabama, Florida and South Carolina. Winters are mild throughout the state, although temperatures exhibit considerable geographic variation. In January and February, daily highs in the south and along the southeast coast average in the low to mid-60s, highs around Atlanta average in the mid-50s, and highs in the mountains top out only around 50. Overnight lows hover near 40 in the south and on the coast, the low to mid-30s around Atlanta and the upper 20s in the mountains. Flurries and light snow usually fall in northern Georgia a few times per year, but the chance of seeing snow decreases further south. Measurable snowfall or ice accumulations are rare but are far more likely in the mountains than elsewhere in the state. March and April feature pleasant temperatures, with highs in the 70s and 80s to the south and 60s and 70s to the north, it is a great time to see the new flowers. Temperatures begin to creep up in May, with highs averaging in the low 80s throughout much of the state. Severe thunderstorms can occur in spring, occasionally producing hail and sometimes even spawning tornadoes. April is usually the rainiest month of the year. Most of the state is still hot in September, with highs in the mid-80s. But temperatures drop rapidly, with highs averaging in the 70s in October and the 60s in November when it is great to see the fall foliage. And in the fall, as in late summer, tropical storms and hurricanes can impact the state. Harris, Amy. "Climate in Georgia."

Alpha is a series of sessions exploring the Christian faith in a relaxed, non-threatening, but thought-provoking way. Each week looks at a different question around faith and is designed to create conversation. Alpha is run across the world, and everyone's welcome. It takes place in lots of different settings - cafés, churches, universities, homes, and many more! No two Alphas look the same, but generally they have three key things in common: food, a talk or video, and good conversation. We run a Course each autumn and sometimes at other times of the year, usually on Thursday evenings for nine or ten weeks. Our Summer 2019 Course begins on Thursday 25 April, kicking off with a meal, a glass of wine and a chat, followed by a brief presentation about what will be covered on the Course. Feel free to bring a friend, relative or work colleague with you. On the Course itself, which starts on 2 May and runs weekly until early July, we start with a meal each week, then there's a short talk or video followed by discussion in small groups. You can find out more about Alpha here. For many people in our church, taking part has been a really important way of finding faith or coming back to faith. If you'd like to find out about a future Course please e-mail us for further information. The Marriage Course aims to help couples grow closer and build a healthy relationship that will last for a lifetime. It’s designed for all couples, however long or short a time they’ve been together, and whether they feel they already have a strong relationship or are struggling. While the course is based on Christian principles, it’s designed for couples with or without a Christian faith. Many couples who aren’t churchgoers have commented that the Christian content was presented in a way that didn’t make them feel at all uncomfortable. We run this six week course periodically. Each evening starts with coffee and dessert, followed by a talk on the theme for the evening. You will then spend the rest of the time talking with each other as a couple about things relating to the theme. During the Course you will think and talk about building strong foundations, the art of communication, resolving conflict, the power of forgiveness, the impact of family, intimacy and love in action. Your discussion will be private to you, and there won’t be any group work. While there may be some homework to do, to help you build on what you’ve learnt and to give you the opportunity to apply it to your relationship, no-one else will see it and it’s just for your benefit. You can find out more about The Marriage Course here. If you'd like to find out about a future Course please e-mail us for further information.

Certain metal products can be produced only by powder metallurgy; among these products are materials whose porosity is controlled. Successful production by powder metallurgy depends on the proper selection and control of process variables: powder characteristics; powder preparation; type of compacting press; design of compacting tools and dies; type of sintering furnace; composition of the sintering atmosphere; choice of production cycle, including sintering time and temperature; and secondary operations and heat treatment. When the application of a powder metallurgy part requires high levels of strength, toughness, or hardness, the mechanical properties can be improved or modified by infiltration, heat treatment, or a secondary mechanical forming operation such as cold re-pressing or powder forging. The article also discusses the effect of the secondary processes on P/M mechanical properties.
9th Mountain Mist finish, one more for the coveted 10 time finisher jacket. If you're a Huntsville local, chances are you first learned about the sport of ultrarunning in connection with the Mountain Mist 50K. As one of the oldest ultramarathons in the Southeastern United States and now in its 25th year, the Mountain Mist is still considered one of the toughest by many. It may not have the most vert, but every year trail runners are humbled when they attempt to finish this race. Every year, a slew of new Mountain Misters take off at the start gun at paces that resemble that of a 5K road race and this year as no different. That usually comes back to bite them, maybe not after 17 miles, the unofficial halfway point of the race, when they ran past or jump over the red gate at the Fearn Street crossing, but certainly at mile 23ish, when they start their climb up Waterline Trail. And if they still aren't humbled, they certainly will be by the time they make their way up Crybaby Hill or the final climb to the top of Rest Shelter. Hey, I'm not judging, it took me multiple times to figure out that even though the first half is actually very runnable, it still has nearly 2000ft of vert over 17 miles, which makes the second "half" or remaining 14 miles and 2000ft of vert over 2 major climbs even more challenging, if you failed to hold back a little on the front end. Luckily, It only took me 5 finishes to learn to latch on to "the" veteran of this race, let's call him DeWayne, who is like the metronome of the Mountain Mist. If you want to see what consistent pacing looks like, just watch DeWayne. He's not only one of the fastest runners ever to run the Mountain Mist (9 wins speak for themselves), he also one of the smartest. Oh yeah, he also makes for great conversation on the trails. While many of us get humbled by this race, we come back over and over and over again and it's not just for the coveted 10 time finisher jacket, it much deeper than that. It's a family reunion, but not just for local runners, it's a reunion of runners from around the Southeast. I spend more time catching up with runners before and after the race than I actually do running the race. That is not an exaggeration. It is the reason this is my favorite race year after year. It is also the most important race for me. Whether I have trained for it nor not, I never ever not put it all out there. There is nothing more fun than to race your friends whom you usually train with the rest of the year. Just over half way in and still in good spirits. This year marked my ninth start and finish and while it was fun, it is never easy. In December, I had some grand ambitions of trying to run a personal best. This goal did not change until the weekend before the race, when I bruised a rib during a trail run and woke up with a head cold the following day. Not a great omen for a PR attempt. Feeling sluggish all week, I finally admitted to myself that a PR was out of the question. I entered race weekend with a slightly adjusted goal still ready to run as hard as possible. The plan was to save some on the front half to see how I would have some left in the tank in the latter part of the race to push the pace. I am happy to report that plan worked out for the most part, anyway. After some start line banter and the loud bang of the start signal, we were off. Having run this race 8 times, you kind of fall in with the same group of runners year after year. This year was no different. Even though DeWayne was running with a torn meniscus, he still set the perfect pace. The first few miles went by fairly quickly and were rather uneventful. I tried to make sure not to raise my heart rate too much too early. That also meant hiking rather than running some of the stepper sections of the hills. I cruised into the 17 mile aid station at red gate feeling pretty good and still on target to hit my A goal for the day. The tried and true formula requires you to double your red gate split to come up with your approximate finishing time. If you end up much slower than that, then you most definitely started the race too fast. I was still running by feel. In fact, I checked my time for the first time at red gate AS. I continued to drink a bottle of fluids in between aid stations and take one gel every 45 minutes. I chased that with a couple of SCaps every hour, which kept me fueled evenly and cramp free all day. My pace would fluctuate only very lightly. I would zone out and slow my pace, mostly on the High Trail and Bluffline Trail sections. Eventually, I would snap out of it and pick it back up again. By the time I reached the top of Waterline trail, I started the smell the barn. Another 10K and this thing would be done. I had some renewed energy coming through the Trough Springs AS, but that slowly started to fizzle as I made my way down Natural Well Trail. By the time I reached "slush mile" or the bottom of McKay Hollow Trail, I was ready to be done. One more slow climb up Rest Shelter and all that was left was a 1.7 mile flat stretch to the finish. I declined the beer and chili at the final AS and tried my best to sustain a decent pace. When I finally crossed the finish line, I had reached my A goal and was another step closer to my 10 time finisher jacket. I spent the next 3 hours reminiscing about the day with my trail family. I am already looking forward to 2020 and my 10th finish. Never leave anything in the tank when running your local favorite.
Poly(triazine imide) with incorporated lithium chloride has recently attracted substantial attention due to its photocatalytic activity for water splitting. However, an apparent H/Li disorder prevents the delineation of structure-property relationships, for example, with respect to bandgap tuning. Herein, we show that through a combination of one-and two-dimensional, multinuclear solid-state NMR spectroscopy, chemical modelling, automated electron diffraction tomography, and an analysis based on X-ray pair distribution functions, it is finally possible to resolve the H/Li substructure. In each cavity, one hydrogen atom is bound to a bridging nitrogen atom, while a second one protonates a triazine ring. The two lithium ions within each cavity are positioned between two nitrogen atoms of neighbouring triazine rings. The thereby induced local dipole moments cause slight buckling of the framework and lateral displacements of the Cl- ions at a coherence length below 2 nm. Nevertheless, the average structure conforms to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1). In this way, we demonstrate that, in particular, the above-mentioned techniques allow for smart interplay in delineating the real structure of PTI/LiCl. Mesch, Maria B., et al.

The coastal cleanup was part of SPECTO’s ongoing efforts to conserve Leatherback turtles, which nest on Levera Beach. Funds for the scholarship are raised at the Grenada Houston Association’s Annual Fund-Raising Gala. A total of EC$1.3 million was allocated for the Reconstruction Of The Top-Hill Senior Citizen Home in Carriacou. The competition which targeted pupils at the primary school level took the form of a “Mini Arts Festival”.
A trip across the river from Vancouver into Oregon found a few folks selling daffodils from the roadside. A beautiful sight after a gray winter. Above you can take your pick of flowers for $2.00 a bunch. Such a deal to bring springtime into your home. I had to use a vehicle pull-off on the highway to take a picture of the mutipaned-window facade. I stepped out of my truck -- wobbled across some slick flat rocks and finally was stopped in my tracks by large twisted brambles. At this point I noticed that the school had a dirt side road. I pulled my small truck out of the pull-off and swung down the road. There were a couple houses down the road. I went down about 200 feet and turned around. This brought me back to the side of the school house where I put on my flashers and took the photo below. I noticed the school bell was still hanging near one of the entrances while an American flag flew from its pole (as seen in the top photo). Two doors indicated to me that the boys usually lined up at one and the girls the other and a posted bird feeder was between them. The clue to its age was on the school's sign affixed in its gable -- along with the school's name, Prindle, with the date 1912. That would make the age of the school about 98 years old. I went home and goggled the school. All the information I could find was that is was located in Skamania County, Washington -- that is was named after a German sailor and that there was a Polish community established nearby in 1870. Today, this is still a lovely quaint school house with I'm sure many stories.

Last Saturday I took a ride on the Lewis and Clark Highway here in Washington. It runs along the Columbia River. I didn't know what to expect as I had not taken this route before -- I just wanted to find something to photograph as I have been at a loss finding subject matter in Vancouver. I was pleasantly surprised at the beautiful wildness of the area. The day was rainy and very overcast but I still tried to catch some shots of the area. In the photo above I was looking from the Washington side over to the Oregon side when I took this photo of twin Oregon falls that are in abundance along Oregon's river roadway. Oregon and Washington border each other and are separated by the Columbia River. In my bottom photo is the wild type of landscapes one encounters on the highway on the Washington side. I plan on taking in this area again as I only saw a small portion of its beauty. Hopefully I will pick a non-rainy day with some sun. Labels: COLUMBIA RIVER, LEWIS AND CLARK HIGHWAY, WASHINGTON STATE. All photos appear as slices of time. In the scene above I had the feeling that time was standing still -- reflecting a certain loneliness. My photo above of the vacant country house was taken a few years ago when I was living in Kentucky. The owner, who lived nearby, told me the house had belonged to his family -- he shared a few personal memories with me -- about his time spent there as a boy. Yesterday while perusing my files I came upon this photo from the past and was struck by its aura of coldness in addition to its loneliness. As I gazed at it I reached back remembering the personal boyhood memories that the owner shared with me. Time -- stood still at the vacant country house. A photo's slice of time can give us a full range of feelings. Our interpretation is not always right but sometimes it is. Sometimes we know -- for no particular reason -- that something was amiss but we just cannot put our finger on it. Frequently seen along the countryside throughout Madison County, Kentucky during the warm seasons is this vintage style swan planter made of cement. This particular swan planter used to sit on a porch of an elderly man that placed flowers in it every year in memory of his departed wife. He told me the planter was her favorite. This swan sat on his front porch along his curving holler road. Sometimes material objects that we think of as insignificant in our life can become very significant. Lancaster has many early historic homes in original condition. Above is a finely crafted fireplace that dates to around the early to mid 1800s at which time this fireplace would have been crafted by local craftsmen out of virgin timber. I am amazed at the beauty of the workmanship -- cove moldings, shadows of original dental moldings, and line carvings. Revealing the underlying historic paint colors on the fireplace can help preservation efforts in choosing the appropriate paints for the fireplace. At the time I took this photo the whole house was undergoing some preservation work giving it a fresh vitality. Nice to know this fireplace will be remaining to keep the new occupants cozy.

Building handmade houses for Purple Martins became a passion of Mr. Cain during the time he worked at a transfer station in Kentucky. A transfer station is where you take used materials to be transferred to appropriate land fills. While working at the station he noticed a few things; 1) some reusable building materials were being thrown away, 2) early spring arriving Purple Martins were checking out this location for possible nesting sites as it was located in open acreage, and 3) he slowly had become fascinated with the flying martins. So began a sideline of building martin houses that he placed around the station. He also built martin houses for folks that brought materials to be transferred. All his houses were built with the cast-off materials that folks so willingly threw away at the station. Most houses were three-holers while a very few were the regulation size that one sees for sale in farm supply stores. Having a sense of what it takes to attract martins he eventually had a thriving community of martins that returned every year. He eventually ended up with a cluster of 15 folksy martin houses. When I used to visit Mr Cain, at his work space, I was received by the aerial antics of the insect-eating martins that swooped and dove in midair for their meals. I understood how one could get hooked on having a martin house in their yard. All the above houses are part of those designed and made by Mr. Cain for his workplace. Mr Cain retired a few years ago and since then the houses have, unfortunately, been deteriorating. Purple Martins east of the Rockies need someone to take care of their housing -- approximately one million folks in eastern North America put up housing for these totally house dependent martins. West of the Rockies martins are not dependent on folks to provide housing. Here is an excellent site, The Purple Martin Conservation Association, that has information on such subjects as migration maps and behavior.

Islamabad: Pakistan air Force has simply denied all news that a special C-130 airlifted a horse to Qatar, gifted by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to the Emir of Qatar, reported DawnNews. "It is clarified that the news aired on some channels regarding the airlift of a horse to Qatar in a C-130 aircraft is baseless and incorrect," said the PAF spokesperson. The spokesperson added that the PAF strongly denies the content of this news. But a letter by government to PAF for special aircraft (C-130) carrying a horse will travel to Qatar on 1 February, 2017 instead of 28 January, 2017 is circulating on Social media.

I was browsing through Alistair Cooke's "The Americans" the other day, and I found a passage in which Cooke says that an unnamed American political columnist gave Jimmy Carter 20 numbered pieces of advice just before he was to take office as President. "This attack of bile, I don't doubt, must have been brought on by unpleasant memories of Mr. Nixon's occupation of the White House, for nobody in American history, I dare say, has given the language of sport such a bad name by using it to recommend a strategy of deceit." Richard Nixon used to like football as a metaphor for politics, diplomacy and warfare. He was not alone in this. I remember when Gerald Ford, before he succeeded Spiro Agnew as Nixon's vice president, said (regarding some of the spirited criticism of the Nixon Vietnam policy): "You don't go out and tackle your quarterback once he has called the play." I thought at the time that if your quarterback appeared demented and was running in the wrong direction, tackling him mightn't be a bad idea. I think a great many American men find football talk irresistible as a demonstration of two-fisted he-manship, and I suspect that that is one reason Vice President George Bush, a couple of days after his first debate with Michael Dukakis, gave a speech in which he used a plethora of football images. He had the Democrats "punting on first down," and he said that the Republican team now had the ball and was going to march, march on down the field, and I thought that at any minute he might break into a chorus of "Boola-Boola" and "Bulldog! Bulldog! Bow! Wow! Wow!" As a way of shaking off a wimp image, football lingo probably seems very tempting. I feel uneasy when powerful public figures shift into the gridiron mode in discussing the life-and-death affairs that affect all of us on this precious, precarious planet. There are just enough similarities between football and war to lure us into confusing the two. Football even has The Bomb. For those who are too inactive or, like millions of wives, too intellectual to watch football on the tube, where we athletes learn the language, The Bomb is a long forward pass. Our pass receiver scampers through the defensive backfield and makes a dash for the enemy goal line. Our quarterback unleashes The Bomb, a forward pass of perhaps 65 yards that lands on the sticky fingers of the receiver. Our receiver then carries The Bomb jubilantly into the end zone for a touchdown. As bombs go, it's not bad. The only explosion it causes is the roar of the fans, and it's quite harmless to the public. In another section of Cooke's work, he attempts to enlighten his countrymen on the mysteries of American football. He says, ". . . No American institution is worse understood abroad than American football. British sportsmen . . . succumb without a second thought to the facetious view of American football as a mindless bout of mayhem between brutes got up in spacemen outfits. . . . American football is an open-air chess game disguised as warfare. It is without question the most scientific of all outdoor games." This, of course, was written years before our football teams went over to capture the hearts and minds of the British. I hope that, whoever our next President may be, he will stay away from the football metaphor. The trouble isn't so much that it is inept as that it tends to blur the borders between sport, whose impact is fleeting, and the real world, whose impact can be permanent and maybe terminal. When you start thinking of the real world in terms of quarterbacks, punting, first downs and marching on down the field, it is difficult not to think also in terms of half-times, closing minutes and final guns. And when you start thinking of such unreal particulars as the final seconds of the closing minutes, and you decide that it's time to use the bomb, and when it is truly in your power to use The Bomb, the final guns could be not just the final guns, but the honest-to-God beginning of the no-kidding final guns--and that is very frightening.

One of the new features in DB2 version 9 which got a lot of attention is certainly 'Row Compression'. While compression algorithms are in place already in DB2 before version 9 (for instance backup compression, value compression), row compression is unique for several reasons. But first let's distinguish between value compression and row compression. Both methods are used to compress table data and therefore save space in the database. Value compression, available since version 8.1 of DB2, does so by introducing a new row format which saves space for certain data types if they are empty or SQL null. applicability in SAP systems Row compression on the other hand uses standard data compression algorithms to compress a row. This includes the creation of a 'dictionary' which defines symbols for particular groups of bytes which appear frequently in the table data. To be more precise, row compression in DB2 uses a lossless compression technique with a static dictionary and works on a 'per table' basis. Static here means that the dictionary, once build, is fixed and will not change upon INSERTs or UPDATEs. The dictionary must exists before the table can be compressed. Creation of the dictionary and compressing the table is done in one step with an offline table REORG. To create the dictionary, the algorithm looks for repeating entries (or patterns) in rows. These entries may span over several adjacent columns. They are replaced by a symbol and the symbol is stored together with the repeating entries in the dictionary. During decompression (which is completely transparent to the database user) the DBMS replaces the symbols found in a row with the entries which are stored in the dictionary for this symbol. This way, a row gets shorter on disk and more rows will fit into one page. The dictionary itself is stored together with the table data and is not accessible from the outside. Upon access to a compressed table the dictionary is loaded into (DBHEAP-)memory for faster decompression. Dictionaries can not exceed the size of 150 KByte, they are usually about 75 KByte in size. As indexes are used for fast access to records index data will not be compressed. Also, long and LOB table data is not compressed. Compressed data is represented as it is in the buffer pool. In other words, the content of the buffer pool is also compressed if it is related to a compressed table. This allows for a more effective memory usage. As already mentioned, row compression works on a per table basis (it can be switched on for single tables). In case of a multi partition environment, it works on a 'per table/per partition' basis in the sense that every compressed table has their own dictionary on every partition. DB20000I The INSPECT command completed successfully. Compression dictionary size: 56832 bytes. Expansion dictionary size: 32768 bytes. The two lines 'Percentage of pages/bytes saved from compression' tell us here that a space reduction by 87% is expected from row compression which is certainly a lot. (I can now admit that I selected this table as it constitutes a very good showcase for row compression :). Also, the complete dictionary size for the table (on this partition) is estimated with 56832 + 32768 = 89600 Bytes = 87,5 KByte. This table is identified as an rewarding object for row compression. The next step is to switch on row compression. This is done with the new addition 'COMPRESS YES' for the ALTER TABLE statement. Note that this addition is also available for the CREATE TABLE statement. In both cases the table will not be compressed with this statement! Instead it is more that the specified table is now 'eligible' from compression. The field 'COMPRESSION' in the SYSCAT.TABLES view tells us if compression is switched on for a table or not. REORG has the two new options RESETDICTIONARY and KEEPDICTIONARY. So it is possible to do a reorganization without running the compress algorithm again by retaining an existing dictionary. For the exact meaning of these options please lookup REORG in the DB2 Command Reference. With ADMIN_GET_TAB_INFO I can check the size of the dictionary. Exactly like estimated by INSPECT it's size is 87.5 KByte. The table now occupies only (273184*100)/2075296 = 13.1% of the original space on disk so that indeed 100% - 13% = 87% of the disk space are saved. Now you may think that every good thing has a downside. Do we have to pay for these space savings? It is very difficult to find a general answer for the costs associated with row compression. Obviously, we need more CPU time for decompression. If on the other hand your database is more I/O bound the savings from less I/O may (and in most cases will) outperform these additional CPU cycles. So there is no universal answer. Otherwise we can examine how the various SQL statements are affected by row compression. Remember that the algorithm works with a static dictionary which is not changed by DML statements issued against a compressed table. From measurements conducted by our IBM colleagues here at SAP (thanks!) we found out that there is nearly no overhead for SELECTs and only a small overhead for INSERTs. UPDATEs to existing rows need a bit more attention. If the update changes the table data in a way that a compression symbol must be expanded to the original entries the row will to be larger after the update than before. As a result the row will not fit in its original location. If there is still free space left on the data page DB2 will do a page reorg to assemble the free space and fit the row back in. If there is not enough free space DB2 will need to create an overflow record (that means that only a pointer will be left on the page and the remainder of the row will be stored on another page). These additional operations will bring along some additional cost if they occur. You therefore may see a slight decrease in update performance compared to an uncompressed table. It very much depends on your actual data and your update frequency if you see a decrease in update performance. Regarding the compression ratio, 87% like in this example is certainly a very good showcase. For the most tables which are suitable for row compression a compression rate around 70% would be more realistic. Row compression is a very useful feature and it will be supported by various SAP products. Starting today you can transparently enable row compression for any table in your SAP system through a manual DBA action. To find suitable candidates for row compression in your SAP system the new UDF 'INSPECT_TABLE_ROWCOMPESTIMATE' is available. UDF can be used. The note also describes how to create DB2 scripts to enable row compression on multiple tables. SAP BI will fully support DB2 row compression starting with it's next version. Row compression will become the default for BI fact tables. Support for existing versions of SAP BI/BW is also available soon, There will be more information about row compression in SAP BI posted on SDN soon. R3load has the new option '-loadprocedure fast COMPRESS'. Started with this option it loads part of the data, does a REORG to create the compression dictionary and then loads the rest of the data. This way the table does not grow up to it's full size before it is compressed. The SAP DBA Cockpit (transaction 'DBACOCKPIT') will fully support row compression starting with the next release of SAP Netweaver. See below a sneak preview from one of our development systems. Note that the development is still ongoing here and there might be changes! The 'Single Table Analysis' shows if a row and/or value compression is switched on for the table. The picture shows the state of our table after row compression took place. On the new compression tab you can find all information regarding row compression. All the things I did above manually (including the INSPECT run) can be scheduled very easy via the DBA cockpit. Johannes Heinrich Johannes works as a developer in the 'DB2 UDB for Unix and Windows' porting team at SAP. Excellent piece of information. we look forward for more such papers from the author..

I normally blog only once daily but I found the stats presented here so cool that I had to post a mid-day entry. Although honestly, I doubt its accuracy as the usage of Internet from China alone could own anyone; it’s as if they exist in their own Internet universe. It got me thinking about how we actually utilise this surfeit of information. For a good number of people, especially youths, their daily navigation do not go beyond three to four websites (I’m guessing Facebook, Youtube, Gmail and their blogs). May I urge all of us to make fuller use of the Internet for all its worth instead of idling our time away on it. Nonetheless, enjoy the stat attack! (Source: “15 things I bet you didn’t know about the internet” from Curious? Read.) May it give you some interesting perspectives.

Discussion in 'General Mac Discussion' started by mac15, Feb 18, 2002. i changed the splash screen for netscape and OS 9. the rest of the system sounds were the same platnum ones. I think I did some other stuff to.. but I dont remember. I havent messed with OS X yet. I like the interface too much to mess with it yet. Ill do it when I get bord of it some day... if I get bord some day. ... PS.. if anyone want to check out my sound set... I can send it to you if you like. could you send it to me? thanks. are low tech mods... I just put the system7 sound files in the shutdown and startup folders. I have those if you guys want those too. oh... by the way... I sent my sound set to you this morning. Does anybody know if there are any Resourse editors for X?? or does X not have resources structured in an editable fashion like 9 and previous??? Dude, resexellence.com isnt up. either that or my computer is just whacked. any other sites?
I have often heard people saying that why convolutional neural networks are still poorly understood. Is it known why convolutional neural networks always end up learning increasingly sophisticated features as we go up the layers? What caused them create such a stack of features and would this also be true for other types of deep neural networks? Actually I guess the question is a bit broad! Anyway. What is learned in ConvNets tries to minimize the cost function to categorize the inputs correctly in classification tasks. All parameter changing and learned filters are in order to achieve the mentioned goal. They try to reduce the cost by learning low level, sometimes meaningless, features like horizontal and vertical lines in their first layers and then stacking them to make abstract shapes, which often have meaning, in their last layers. For illustrating this fig. 1, which has been used from here, can be considered. The input is the bus and the gird shows the activations after passing the input through different filters in the first layer. As it can be seen the red frame which is the activation of a filter, which its parameters have been learned, has been activated for relatively horizontal edges. The blue frame has been activated for relatively vertical edges. It is possible that ConvNets learn unknown filters that are useful and we, as e.g. computer vision practitioners, have not discovered that they may be useful. The best part of these nets is that they try to find appropriate filters by their own and don't use our limited discovered filters. They learn filters to reduce the amount of cost function. As mentioned these filters are not necessarily known. In deeper layers, the features learned in previous layers come together and make shapes which often have meaning. In this paper it has been discussed that these layers may have activations which are meaningful to us or the concepts which have meaning to us, as human beings, may be distributed among other activations. In fig. 2 the green frame shows the activatins of a filter in the fifth layer of a ConvNet. This filter cares about the faces. Suppose that the red one cares about hair. These have meaning. As it can be seen there are other activations that have been activated right in the position of typical faces in the input, the green frame is one of them; The blue frame is another example of these. Accordingly, abstraction of shapes can be learned by a filter or numerous filters. In other words, each concept, like face and its components, can be distributed among the filters. In cases where the concepts are distributed among different layers, if someone look at each of them, they may be sophisticated. The information is distributed among them and for understanding that information all of those filters and their activations have to be considered although they may seem so much complicated. CNNs should not be considered as black boxes at all. Zeiler et all in this amazing paper have discussed the development of better models is reduced to trial and error if you don't have understanding of what is done inside these nets. This paper tries to visualize the feature maps in ConvNets. ConvNets use pooling layers not only to reduce the number of parameters but also to have the capability to be insensitive to the exact position of each feature. Also the use of them enables the layers to learn different features which means first layers learn simple low level features like edges or arcs, and deeper layers learn more complicated features like eyes or eyebrows. Max Pooling e.g. tries to investigate whether a special feature exists in a special region or not. The idea of pooling layers is so useful but it is just capable to handle transition among other transformations. Although filters in different layers try to find different patterns, e.g. a rotated face is learned using different layers than a usual face, CNNs by there own do not have any layer to handle other transformations. To illustrate this suppose that you want to learn simple faces without any rotation with a minimal net. In this case your model may do that perfectly. suppose that you are asked to learn all kind of faces with arbitrary face rotation. In this case your model has to be much more bigger than the previous learned net. The reason is that there have to be filters to learn these rotations in the input. Unfortunately these are not all transformations. Your input may also be distorted too. These cases made Max Jaderberg et all angry. They composed this paper to deal with these problems in order to settle down our anger as theirs. Finally after referring to these points, they work because they try to find patterns in the input data. They stack them to make abstract concepts by there convolution layers. They try to find out whether the input data has each of these concepts or not in there dense layers to figure out which class the input data belongs to. ConvNets work because they exploit feature locality. They do it at different granularities, therefore being able to model hierarchically higher level features. They are translation invariant thanks to pooling units. They are not rotation-invariant per se, but they usually converge to filters that are rotated versions of the same filters, hence supporting rotated inputs. I know of no other neural architecture that profits from feature locality in the same sense as ConvNets do. One should never forget the other components in a typical ConvNet. The convolution filters pick out the spatial invariant features, like edges and circles. These features are quantified in a pooling layer which follows the C layer. Finally, they are fed into (usually) multiple fully connected layers (fc). Credit must be given to these fully connected layers which are nothing more than what you find in any ordinary MLP. Convolutional neural networks work because it's a good extension from the standard deep-learning algorithm. Given unlimited resources and money, there is no need for convolutional because the standard algorithm will also work. However, convolutional is more efficient because it reduces the number of parameters. The reduction is possible because it takes advantage of feature locality, exactly what @ncasas writes. Is it known why convolutional neural networks always end up learning increasingly sophisticated features as we go up the layers? This is pure mathematics. A neural network, at the end of the day, is a big mathematical function. And the deeper the network, the bigger the function it represents. And by bigger, I obviously mean high-dimensional. The features learned are more sophisticated because they are the results of more sophisticated functions. Interestingly enough, conventional neural networks were inspired by our own, actually cat's, biology. Hubel and Wiesel conducted experiments on the visual cortex of cats, and they realized that light was perceived by stacks of optic fields. This is what inspired convolutional layer and a deeper architecture. They are invavriant to geometrical transformations and learn features that get increasingly complicated and detailed, hence being powerful hierarchical feature extractors thanks to the convolutional layers. They combine the extracted features and aggregate them in a non linear fashion to predict the output and therefore being robust classifiers thanks to the fully connected layers. If you want to learn more about convnets and the different blocks building them as well as the intuitions that underly, here's a post I recently wrote on my personal blog that goes through the details.

We often wonder how often we should go to confession. The answer is simple—whenever you have a serious sin on your conscience. Examine your conscience and beg God to show you’re your faults; if you don’t know who you are then you don’t know what Christ came to save you from. This can be a difficult process, but a necessary one. Such study reveals our self-love by which we blind and deceive ourselves. Our sins offend the Almighty God. He wants to forgive us and share His mercy. We must be satisfied not just with avoiding serious sins, but even the smallest, in an ongoing striving for holiness. Our sins cause ourselves and others unhappiness—why would we want this?! St. John of Kronstadt says that if you live just one day in obedience to all the commandments then you’ll have a foretaste of Heaven. Once we know and detest our faults we can begin to replace them with virtues, but know that this won’t happen all at once. Be the simple, difficult, weak creature that you are, and start small—to try to stop sinning all at once is actually a manifestation of pride. Start with the baby milk of spiritual struggle before moving on to the strong wine. How should we examine our conscience? You should do this daily, taking time at night to reflect. You can use the Ten Commandments, the Beatitudes, and so on, as a guide. My spiritual father, Fr. Seraphim Rose, taught me to consider: How have I sinned against God? against my neighbor? and against myself? Through examining our conscience we begin to discover what is our predominant passion(s)—that sin we fall into most frequently, which tries to master us. This can be the love of ease, love of power, complaining, judgmentalism, and so on. One of the worst things that can happen to us if when someone asks our advice, so we give “learned advice,” but in the end they don’t follow it and we get very upset. To overcome vice we must practice the opposing virtue. The Ladder of Divine Ascent is a great help in this regard. St. John Climacus analyzed each virtue and vice as a master of psychology, seeing cause-effect relationships in a theocentric framework. Identify your predominant vice, locate its opposite virtue and begin to cultivate it. Simply avoiding vice won’t work because then the passion will simply be replaced with other passions. If we do this we will see that the spiritual life works! We don’t like anyone to point out our faults, but in actuality we need our spiritual father to do this. We each have our predominant virtue too. Studying and practicing this tends to draw the other virtues along with it. We can overcome vice by practicing the presence of God, by beginning to develop an awareness that at all times we are in the presence of God and He observes us. The icon corner serves this purpose. It is a two-way window to Heaven. Before doing or saying anything, think to yourself: “Would I do this in Church in front of the altar?” If the answer is “no” then don’t do it. Church is the place par excellence where we come into God’s presence and receive Him. The Theotokos practiced the presence of God more perfectly than anyone else. Her virtues grew and she thus had a powerful influence on other people. People were made better by her mere presence. The predominant passion is pride; it is the mother of all sins. Its opposite is humility. No soul can have any holiness without some humility, and yet pride will lurk in our darkest recesses our whole life. Adam and Eve fell because they listened to the serpent and thought that they knew better than God. This is pride, and now most of us follow two masters—a little pride and a little humility. Pride is the love of self, the beginning of all sin, and the neglect of the fact that we depend on God for everything. What separates us from death is so little. Our lives are very fragile, and pride places us in opposition to God because by it we work only for our own glory. Pride places false regard on the opinion of others, and of ourselves, when the what you think matters more than what God thinks. It is also manifested as desiring a good reputation—to be thought well of, to be honored—and this is a great temptation for priests, with people looking for the latest guide or guru. A priest must do everything to remain humble about what people say. Actually, criticism against a priest is a blessing to keep him humble, which is in turn good for the whole parish. Pride is also seen in being overbearing towards others, insulting or critiquing others, being argumentative, and getting angry easily. The Holy Fathers give us the antidote for going from vice to virtue. The spiritual life is a science, not an art form. Most of us aren’t so spiritually talented so we need laws and cause and effect in order to learn the spiritual life. St. John Climacus says that the antidote for pride is prayer. Identify where the pride is in your life and ask for strength against it. Human effort can do very little. We must realize that everything depends on God. In prayer we make use of God’s grace, and then we can do almost anything—we can move mountains! Pride can also be turned into humility by acts of humility, and especially by accepting humiliations. If someone criticizes you, even unfairly, if someone insults you or talks about you behind your back, instead of becoming defensive, accept it! This cheerful bearing of small failures on the part of ourselves and others is bearing one another’s burdens (see Gal. 6:2). It is important to bear the misunderstandings of others without complaint or self-justification. All too often we’re prone to excuse ourselves and urge our opinions on others. When we learn to accept the humiliations that come our way then we’re learning to be humble. As pride is the mother of all sins, humility is the mother of all virtues. Another serious vice is avarice, which is the opposite of detachment and denunciation. It is the desire for many goods, for power over people, and so on. This passion is combated by cultivating a spirit of generosity. The Lord’s command to give up your coat is quite literal (Mt. 5:40). St. John Maximovitch would often come back practically naked because he had given his clothes away to the poor and starving. St. John of Kronstadt did the same. You don’t have to give away everything, but we should strive to not possess our possessions with our heart. We can have the spirit of poverty even if we aren’t poor—only buying what is absolutely necessary. There was a German Lutheran pastor named Richard Wurmbrandt who was a prisoner of Romanian and Russian Communists. When asked how he could manage solitary confinement he answered that he had had practice beforehand. He suggested that Americans with much wealth go into a store where they have no intention of buying anything, and every time they see something they like, they should go up to it, look at it, and say “I don’t need this.” Do this repeatedly and you train yourself to be detached from worldly goods. He realized that who he is isn’t dependent on what he owns, whereas most of us really do define ourselves by what we surround ourselves with. The Desert Fathers had a Psalter and a vigil lamp and that was it, and they were free and belonged to God. Cultivate generosity and have a spirit of detachment. You can practice this by not using credit cards. We live in a world where it’s possible with a little imagination and a credit card to create an environment straight out of another time, such as colonial America, Tudor England, and so on. Never before was this possible. There’s something very abnormal about it when you think about it. Let’s just live simply and love and care for one another and use our blessings to care for the Church, for the poor, and so on. We need a spirit of detachment from people too. You can have affections that are not immoral but simply too strong. Don’t define yourself in terms of other people. The spirit of Christian poverty allows for what is genuinely needed, but don’t go out and get something just because someone else has it. Of course detachment doesn’t mean laziness, dirtiness, slovenliness, chaos, carelessness, or anything less than orderly and clean—this is a form of self-love. Christian poverty isn’t stinginess—this is avarice. Possession can be a passion that spreads even to things not worth keeping. Avarice regrets that you don’t have what others have. Avarice is stinginess. When you give to a beggar it’s for you. It’s not so much for the beggar—if you’re not willing

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial disorder induced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and epigenetic modifications could be the key to understand the pathogenesis of AD. We performed a methylation study of the promoter regions of the three AD principal causative genes in 60 late-onset AD patients and 60 controls. The studied regions in the three causative genes were strongly unmethylated in both groups, but in AD patients the methylation resulted significantly increased. Our study adds new insights to previous ones by showing the involvement of epigenetic changes in AD, which influence the pathogenesis of the disease.

One mustard base used in tuna, haricots vert, and potatoes make a delicious main dish salad. Place the potatoes and garlic cloves in a small pot and cover with water by about 3 inches. Salt the water, and bring to a boil. Boil the potatoes for 10-15 minutes until fork tender. Drain the potatoes. Discard the garlic cloves. In a bowl, toss the hot potatoes with the butter and two tablespoons of the mustard base. Taste, and add salt and pepper until very flavor. In a separate bowl, combine the tuna, capers, dill, and mayonnaise with one tablespoon of the mustard base. Taste for seasoning. Bring two or so inches of salted water to a boil (in the same pot as you used for the potatoes saves a dish!). Boil the green beans for one minute, then drain and transfer to a bowl. Toss the green beans with one tablespoon of the mustard base, one tablespoon of the vinegar, and a few pinches of salt. Whisk the rest of the mustard base with the minced shallot, 1 tablespoon of the vinegar, the honey, and a few pinches of salt. If the dressing seems too thick, add water a teaspoon at a time to thin it out. I start the potatoes to boil FIRST, then work on the tuna and other salad components while the potatoes boil. Then I boil the green beans in the same pot, and can get this salad done in about 45 minutes, sometimes less if I’m super on the ball. It’s worth it!

Monday night August 16th, at the Jackson County Board meeting in Black River Falls, gun rights supporters assembled in support of DA Fox's decision to not prosecute gun control ordinances he believes are a violation of the U.S. Constitution. His Decision was based on the recent Supreme Court ruling in McDonald v. City of Chicago. Fox stated the decision means several state laws violate the right to keep and bear arms, including those that prohibit carrying a concealed weapon, possession of a firearm in a public building or bar and having an uncased or loaded firearm in a vehicle. He said he will no longer prosecute those violations. About thirty Citizens gathered at the Jackson County Court House to demonstrate their support for DA Fox, and to express their position that the County Board would be overstepping its authority in giving that power to the Corporation Counsel. These Second Amendment supporters were also concerned that the County Board is going to hold, or has held, meetings to find a way to circumvent the DA's decision by authorizing the non-elected Corporation Counsel, Mark Skolos to prosecute those county gun control ordinances which Fox said he will not prosecute. The rally was organized in response to Mark Skolos, who stated he did not agree with DA Fox's decision and that he believes the county's gun ordinances that prohibit carrying a concealed weapon and carrying a firearm in a public building are still enforceable. The rally was hastily organized by local Citizens who got word that this subject was discussed at the August 9th meeting of the Executive and Finance Committee. Organizers contacted Wisconsin Carry, a gun rights advocacy group, which also had representatives there. One of those in attendance was Art Donnelly who said he supports the Constitution and DA Fox's stance to uphold the Constitutional right of the Citizens to keep and bear arms. He said, "The right to keep and bear arms is for our safety." Others expressed their outrage that the County Board may be considering usurping the "dully elected District Attorney and appoint some sort of specially appointed prosecutor."

In Aztec cosmology, the soul’s journey to the Underworld after death leaves them with four destinations: the Sacred Orchard of the Gods, the Place of Darkness, the Kingdom of the Sun, and a paradise called the Mansion of the Moon. The most common deaths end up on their way to Mictlán (Place of Darkness) with its nine levels, crashing mountains and rushing rivers, and four years of struggle. This pantheon of gods and goddesses and the expanse of the 13 Heavens provides the cultural basis for the Day of the Dead customs and celebrations. José Clemente Orozco’s monumental mural, ‘The Epic of American Civilization,’ with the panel commemorating the Aztec Underworld gods in ‘The Coming of Quetzalcoatl (1932-34). The following is provided as a lesson at a fictional school for noble boys and girls, but presents the cosmology quite comprehensively, where the manner of one’s death determines their Land of the Dead destination. Today we will talk of Mictlán and the other mansions of death. Time to start the #LeyendasMexicas. Today I will talk of the Four Houses of the Dead. In particular the journey we have to do while reaching Mictlán. But, before that, you need to know that Mictlantecuhtli, the skeletal Lord of the Land of the Dead is the supreme ruler of Mictlán. He oversees the place of eternal smoke and darkness, along with his consort Mictlancihuatl. El Zapotal, Veracruz, Mexico: Clay sculpture of Mictantecutli, Lord of the Land of the Dead, Mictlan, from the Totonac culture. At sunset, Mictlantechutli, along with Tonatiuh, take their place upon the sun, to illuminate the world of the dead. Tonatiuh, the Star God, becomes Tzontemoc at dusk to light the world of Mictlantecuhtli at night. The legend says that, after Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca created the world, the day and night, they placed Mictalntecuhtli and his wife Mictlancihuatl as Lord and Lady of the underworld. The counterpart of Mictlán is the paradise known as Tlalocán, the home of the god Tlaloc, where the people dead from drowning or lightning would arrive. The Chichihuacuauhco was the first mansion, the place of the dead children. In its middle there was a large tree, whose branches dripped milk, so the children could feed and gain strength. Chichihuacuauhco: Paradise orchard of the gods, full of unique sustenance giving trees, but only available to children. Also known as Tonacacuauhtitlan, it was home to those who had died whilst still suckling. These children would return to the world when the race that is inhabiting the Earth, our world of the Fifth Sun, will be destroyed. That is why their death was necessary, because they were chosen to populate the Earth in the future, when no one will be left alive. It was believed that these children reincarnated after their death in this mansion, where they lived physically until they were called by the gods. Then Mictlán was the second house. People who eventually succumbed to illness and old age went to Mictlán. In order to reach it, the soul has to make a four year journey, passing through nine layers of the Underworld and various daunting tests. First, the dead would come to a place where a great river called Apanohuaya (where one crosses the river) roared along, wide and gushing, intimidating and impossible to swim across. To cross it one needed the help of an Itzcuintli (xoloitzcuintle), a special dog each family raised and cremated alongside the mourned deceased. Dogs were associated with the deity Xolotl, the god of death. The roundness of the body might suggest its value as food for the posthumous soul. Image: Xolotl from the 15th century Codex Fejervary-Mayer. Upon recognizing his dead master, the dog would bark, then rush to help the deceased to cross the river, carrying its master upon his back while swimming. After the crossing, the deceased was stripped of all his clothes, beginning the second part of his journey between two mountains that conflicted with each other. This pass was called Tepetl Monamiclia, and the deceased would make his way warily, haunted by the fear that the two mountains would clash, crushing the passing traveler. At the end of the pass, the deceased would be forced to walk down the hill strewn with flints and sharp obsidian, made of the same material as our knives, called Ilztepetl. The stones would cut the dead them as they passed, merciless and relentless. The next stage was the walk through Celhuecayan, eight mountains, covered with perpetual snow that would fall on and on, whipped by strong winds. It was said that the winds in these moors were so cold and strong it would cut the body as obsidian blades. After this the dead would arrive at the foot of the hill, the last stop in the first part of the journey called Paniecatacoyan. These moors were cold and large, where the dead would have to walk endlessly, crossing the desolated land. Done with the first test, the dead would take a long path, where they would be struck with arrows. This place was called Temiminaloyan and the arrows were fired by unseen hands, trying to harm the passersby. At the end of the path, they would arrive at the place inhabited by thousands of fierce beasts. When any of the beasts reached them, the passersby would have to throw open their chests and let the beasts eat their hearts, Tecoylenaloyan. Afterwards, they would be force to dive into the Apanuiayo, where the water was black, and where the lizard called Xochilonal had lived. The dead would have to swim in this lake, dodging the animals, including the terrifying lizard to get to the next test. Next, they would have to wade through nine rivers, on a path of mist and dark, called Izmictlan Apochcalolca. The sun never rose in this place. Finally, tired, injured and exhausted with suffering, they would reach their final destination on Chicunamictlan, where they would meet Mictlantecuchtli, the fierce God of the Death, who would receive them with vengeance. Here the cycle would end forever and here they would live until their bodies and their lives would extinguish. The long journey lasted for four years, in which the deceased came to his eternal rest. This was the mansion to which came most of the dead, people who would die of natural causes. The third house was the Kingdom of the Sun. Here the warriors, slaughtered at the hands of their enemies, would rest. Also included were the souls of those women who died in childbirth. Among the Aztecs, the pregnant woman was like a warrior who symbolically captured her child for the Aztec state in the painful and bloody battle of birth. Considered as female aspects of defeated heroic warriors, women dying in childbirth became fierce goddesses who carried the setting sun into the netherworld realm of Mictlán. This place was outside the time, a wonderful infinite place, a beautiful plain, and every time the sun would come up, they would hear the sound of the warriors beating their shields. After four years, these warriors would turn into rich bird-feathers, small, living creatures eating the flowers. The iconography of Tonatiuh’s attire provides a visual explanation for what his role as the sun god entailed. The deity is usually depicted with arrows and a shield to show that he is a warrior. Tonatiuh often carries a maguey spine in one hand to signify that he takes part in bloodletting practices as a means of sacrifice. The importance of sacrifice is also reinforced by depictions of balls of eagle feather or the eagle itself, which were markers of sacrifice. Tonatiuh’s connection to the sun leads us to believe that the eagle is a reference to the ascending and descending eagle talons, which is a visual metaphor for capturing the heart or life force of a person. [From Townsend, Richard (1979). ‘State and Cosmos in the Art of Tenochtitlan’. Washington D.C.: Dumbarton Oaks]. Upon the Earth, in our world of the Fifth Sun, these birds were treated with honor, because we knew they were the souls of the warriors who had died in a battle. These birds are hummingbirds. Some would also become butterflies. The fourth house was what Catholics took for a paradise. Those who had died by drowning, lightning, and other deaths related to water and rain would arrive at Tlalocán, the Mansion of the Moon, a place of unending springtime and a paradise of green plants. This place belonged to Tlaloc (Nahuatl: “He Who Makes Things Sprout”). The dead arriving here would live happy, fresh and unconcerned. These dead were not cremated, but buried, interred with a piece of wood which was believed to sprout leaves and flowers once the person had entered Tlalocán. Here people enjoyed food and fruits in abundance, a luxury deserving the realm of the supreme god of rain and agriculture. And so, between those mansions the dead Mexica were divided, each person going to his designated place in the Mexican Underworld.

Lancaster-based artist delights ramblers with his striking work but you have to be quick to see them. Roger Borrell reports. Most artists dream of having their work in a famous gallery or an august museum, but Richard Shilling knows his creations rarely survive the ravages of time. And he’s delighted. The Lancaster-based artist works with nature, finding beauty in a pile of polished stones or a diaphanous leaf blown from the trees in an autumn breeze. He takes them and makes sculptures from the natural materials he finds around him, preserving them only with photographs taken without the aid of any technical trickery. He then lets nature take its course as the elements reclaim them. Walkers in Lancashire, the Lakes and Yorkshire will often turn a corner and be pleasantly surprised – and perhaps a little intrigued - to find a finely balanced set of symmetrical stones or leaves sewn into a box placed in a remote corner of the countryside. Melted Ice Imprint: Section of ice chopped from a small pool on Clougha Pike. Richard pressed his hand into the ice to create a melted imprint. Sometimes you need to be very quick to catch them. One remarkable work involved a section of ice chopped from a small pool on Clougha Pike. Richard pressed his hand into the ice to create a melted imprint. Now he is sharing his passion as the artist in residence at the Middlewood Trust at Roeburndale, just south of the pretty village of Wray. The trust aims to advance research and provide education in techniques of agriculture, forestry, wildlife and countryside management, building, energy conservation and human lifestyle which are in tune with the natural cycle and do not upset the long term ecological balance. It is based in idyllic semi-ancient woodlands and over three decades it has provided a place of education on all aspects of low-impact living. Courses range from spoon-carving and coppicing to greenwood furniture making and yurt building. Richard hosts some of the courses there as well as staging workshops at Muncaster Castle near Ravenglass. ‘My art is all about making a connection with nature, something that is fundamental to maintaining good mental health,’ he said. ‘I instruct in techniques that are very accessible, easy to follow and put into practice, so no artistic talent is required from anyone who comes along to one of my events. ‘We use the inherent beauty of nature to guide us through the process. Almost universally, people attending find a new way to connect to themselves and to the natural world and leave the session refreshed with a big smile on their faces. Why not take a leaf out of Richard’s book? Denizen of Antizen: Balancing pebbles in a fissure in the cliff at Half Moon Bay, Heysham.

Have you ever had the situation where you believed in something so strongly that it happened? Were there times you didn’t take any action because you could not properly predict the outcome? Just like all the Asian Men out there, I too have experienced many times of being humbled. Do you remember the first time your dad took off the training wheels on your bike? I still remember it. It was the time where I felt supremely invincible. Well maybe not that invincible, but I was able to pick myself up from any pain or adversity endured. The first time I fell off my bike merely moments after those two little rear wheels were taken off. It was the first time I realized you had to keep pedaling to stay balanced or come tumbling onto the pavement. I remember the tears that came along with the minor cuts on my knee, but I wasn’t crying because I couldn’t do it, it was simply because I was in pain. I fell for a second time because I didn’t know how to properly ascend a sidewalk from the road, and a third for not properly counterbalancing my turning. Yes it hurt, but I truly believed that I was capable of riding a bike. In other words this was the beginning of building my own self-efficacy. Now you may confuse this with the term confidence, but this much more than the strength of belief in a particular outcome. I would describe self-efficacy as a belief that competencies are attainable, regardless of the setbacks that occur along the way. Now everyone will choose different skill sets and interests, but they tend to gravitate to areas where there are levels of success. Who would enjoy doing something that you always lost at? For every sport, video game, or interest we experienced some sort of success that kept us going forward. There was just the right mix of challenge and skill that kept our interest levels up. We knew there were opportunities to improve and eventually achieve a high level of success. The biggest problem for Asian Men is that societal expectations and popular culture does not emphasize self-efficacy, but place a perceived value on a pseudo-confidence that borders arrogance and selfishness. There is no secret that a tall athletic built male with a chiseled jaw line can be forgiven for his bravado, but is that a true qualifier for Asian Men to be attractive? Certainly it is an uphill battle, but the most important thing is not to be discouraged. I simply say this is because the “confidence” that mainstream society is accustomed to perceiving is not as readily apparent in Asian Males, and thus they may seem less desirable. So be sure what archetype you identify with – that goes for both ones looking for an AMWF Relationship or who are already in an AMWF Relationship.

OneFold Records > House > Going Global EP – AndMe. AndMe. — Going Global EP – AndMe. Going Global is the new EP from one of Onefold’s hottest producers, AndMe. After flexing his talents earlier this year with ‘Mixed Emotions‘ & ‘The Arrival‘ , we’re proud to present this – his first solo EP with the label – and it’s safe to say he’s off to a flying start. Capturing an unmistakable energy with both tracks, he fuses an infectious vocal hook with a thick, punchy beat on ‘Dance’, to create a sound worthy of any main room. And giving us another dance floor staple in ‘Get It’, AndMe. builds this stripped back cut around a short, stabbing beat, switching up the pace to create a fresh sound that’s sure to hook any crowd.
Ofita has furnished the new Aldo – Unión headquarters in Esplugues de Llobregat. The company, which has over 50 years in the pharmaceutical market, made the decision to build a new building to place its headquarters. In this project, it has opted for single-colour office furniture for workstations and mix of materials for meeting rooms. It has attached great importance to informal areas where employees can meet and collaborate in a more relaxed way.
Using photography in marketing of products is a popular sales method. Consumers have short attention spans. They also need to see the same message or image repeatedly, for the message to reach them. This must happen before consumers can make the decision to purchase the product. This is why quality photography is critical, in getting the attention of consumers rather than turning them away. Marketing managers are responsible for ideas on how to make the perfect images for glossy magazines ads, signs, and billboards. Photographers must turn ideas created by marketers, into visual stories that consumers will notice and think about. If the image isn’t interesting, viewers may pass by and glance, but won’t give it a second thought. Product images are produced one of two ways. They are either images of the real product or are images created by graphic artists, capable of accurately reproducing the image. Whether the image is an attractive bottle of cologne or an icy drink can, the reflections that can detract from the image are eliminated in professionally created pictures. The real work starts after the concept or idea is presented. Creating original pictures that accurately reflect the message and making them look flawless is the challenge of product photography. A chilled drink can with a depiction of ice droplets or an icy fog surrounding it is what creates the story that will pique the interest of the consumer. An effective image gets the consumer to think about an action, such as consuming the product. This is what leads to consumer purchase decisions. To create the right picture and combine it with other aspects of the ad, like the right text font, with a style that suits the image, takes a keen eye for photography and marketing. The effective image gets the attention of consumers in a positive way. A picture is truly worth “a thousand words” in terms of marketing photography. Producing an advertising photo that accurately reflects the brand and related products takes a good eye and plenty of talent. A passionate marketing photograph understands what it takes to capture the essence of the image and turn it into something consumers will pay attention to. A marketing manager won’t accept anything less than the perfect image of the product. So, the photographer must get it right the first time, by producing the best image possible, which creates the right story to draw in consumers.

Despite Baker’s admiration for Spengler’s intellect and erudition, he is ‘eliminated at once’, along with Nietzsche, ‘as irrelevant to the ethnic problem’, as he ‘makes it abundantly clear that the Volk was not an ethnic taxon.’1 Baker’s purpose in writing Race was to define and classify races or what he called ‘ethnic taxa’ in a biological way. Spengler would have rejected such categorizing as an expression of the English materialistic Zeitgeist of weighing and measuring all things. For Darwinian scientists such as Baker, Spengler’s definition of a ‘race’ was ‘remarkable’, to use Baker’s word, insofar as it seemed odd. Liberals are obliged to recognize differences in ‘race’ because of the adverse medical impact in trying to ignore them. Professor Mansfield is concerned that studies and warnings about poor diet among Afro-American mothers might result in perpetuating racial stereotypes, which epigenetically become real; yet the option is to ignore these problems to the detriment of public health. That is a predicament for those who deny that ‘race’ has any meaning other than as a socio-political method of exploitation. Epigenetics might explain the hitherto mysterious mechanism by which a ‘race soul’ might be formed and inherited. The same principles of epigenetics are applicable to all races, or ethne, as responses to challenges and other shared experiences, whose impact is often reinforced by myths, legends, ritual and customs. Indeed that is the purpose of legends, myths and the religious forms they take. It is the meaning of history and the definition of ‘culture’. The steppes shaped the Russian psyche, the seas the English. Spengler explained race-formation by such concepts. Epigenetics might explain the hitherto mysterious mechanism by which a ‘race soul’ – or Jung’s collective unconscious if one prefers – might be formed and inherited. 2F.

New York City is called "The City That Never Sleeps," and when visiting this exciting destination with the whole family, it may seem that neither do the kids. The Big Apple is a hotbed of activity all week long, but many traditional tourist attractions are closed on Sunday nights, including most of the top museums. Fortunately, armed with some good tips, families can find something to do anytime of the week, even on a Sunday night. The bright lights of Times Square are always fun at night. Several famous toy, gift and fashion stores provide entertainment for kids of all ages, and adults will appreciate the grand scale of the ADHD-proof television screens and lighting. The area, which is centered at the intersection of Broadway and Seventh Avenue, has an overwhelming number of family restaurants ranging from well-known chains to independent eateries. Certainly better places to eat abound in the city, but sometimes it's easier for family members to agree on a restaurant chain everyone already knows. The world’s most famous city park is particularly busy on the weekend, but it provides a relaxing escape from the street crowds and pushy taxi drivers. Most people stay in the southern half of the park, which features the Wollman ice skating rink, the Heckscher Playground and the John Lennon “Strawberry Fields” memorial. Another highlight is the 106-acre Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir, located just north of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In the summer, most of the parks in New York host free concerts on different nights, many of which feature well-known acts. Children will enjoy the Central Park Zoo and carousel, but Conde Nast Traveler suggests not taking one of the cliché, overpriced carriage rides popularized by scenes from Woody Allen’s “Manhattan.” The park closes at 1 a.m., but tourists should stay in the main areas after nightfall. Sunday is a big day for stage productions as the theaters often host both afternoon matinees and nighttime performances. More progressive plays and musicals may be found off-Broadway, but the giant Broadway productions are most likely to entertain the entire family. At time of publication, long-running classics included “Wicked,” and “The Lion King” but you could consider an edgier production like "Chicago" or "Hamilton" if the children are all in their teens. Discounted tickets for some productions can be purchased at the TKTS Booth in Times Square. Jenison, David. "Fun Things to Do on a Sunday Night With Family in NYC."

This plant is a member of the Solanaceae family and has over 4,000 years of traditional use in its native India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. It is a Medharasayan which is the Ayurvedic category of foods and nutrients that promote learning and memory retrieval. It is sometimes referred to as “Indian Ginseng” as it is traditionally used in conditions of debility, emaciation, impotence and premature aging. It is also sometimes referred to as Winter Cherry. The translation of Ashwagandha is roughly, “the smell and strength of a horse”, alluding to its aphrodisiac properties. This plant is a Tonic and an Adaptogen. In the Middle East it is used to help promote normal sleep patterns and encourage a healthy inflammatory response. Adaptogens support the ability of an organism to cope with stress and thereby conserve energy. Ashwagandha rejuvenates and tonifies the entire system, especially the endocrine and immune systems. The root and leaf contain the highest amount of Steroidal compounds which include the lactones Withaferin A, and carbon-27-glycowithanolides, known collectively as Withanolides. It also contains a fair amount of alkaloids; tropine, pseudotropine isopelletrine, and anaferine, and saponins. Altern. Med. Rev. 2000 Aug; 5(4): 334-46 Mishra LC, Singh BB, Dagennais S.

1 – Developed a motion to be introduced at City Council for a moratorium on market housing development. Motion endorsed by 44 groups. 1) The city buys 12 more sites and gets an MOU with the province to build social housing on them. 2) The city starts a DTES visioning process to evolve after 1.5 years into implementation. 3) The city tries to slow soft conversions by getting the province to provide incentives to landlords (Plant and Forbes-Roberts evidently already working on this). 3 – Met with Peter Ladner, NPA councilor and Brent Toderian, Director of Planning, re Plan B. Brent said he would defer to Cameron’s recommendation on housing, talk to the DTES planner, Jessica Chen, about visioning, and said he wouldn’t support the mechanisms we listed to slow down speculation. Ladner said they were short of money to buy land, he could maybe go for a 6 month vision process, and he didn’t like the 20% social housing requirement if it was a code for a moratorium. He said he’d take something to the NPA caucus this week (week of June 9) and put some kind of motion on the City’s website on June 16. We asked for meetings with Vision and one is hopefully being set up. We have been emailing Cadman and keeping him up to date. 4 – Met with Jill Davidson and Andrea (Housing Centre) and Jessica Chen (DTES planner). City staff showed us a new report on DTES housing that claims we’re on track replacing the lost hotel rooms. They do this by including provincially owned hotels as NEW social housing and by NOT counting soft conversions of hotel rooms to tourist hotels and higher rents. But they did indicate that they could support some sort of visioning and developing some mechanisms of dealing with the pace of development if Council asks them to. 5 – Meanwhile we are trying to pressure Concord Pacific to hold off on their plan for 154 condos at 58 W. Hastings by generating 201 letters to the Development Permit Board opposing the development; organizing speakers at the Development Permit Board on June 23rd, getting folks to send letters to the head of Concord Pacific, Terry Hui, and, starting this week, organizing actions focused on the site, office and presentation centre. (a) Write a letter to Hui. Tell him to stop his development at 58 W. Hastings until the community can get a vision together and the city comes up with tools to implement the vision. Alternatively, he could build the development and then turn it over to a non profit group to run as social housing. (b) Visit Hui in his office at 9th floor 1095 W. Pender (near Thurlow). Give him the above message. (c) Email the Development Permit Board, c/o Alison Higginson at Alison.Higginson@vancouver.ca. Tell them not to approve the Concord Pacific condos at 58 W. Hastings until we get social housing for SRO residents and homeless people and a vision for the Downtown Eastside. (d) Sign up to speak at the Development Permit board by emailing lorna.harvey@vancouver.ca.

For both horses and humans. Thank you so much. The Hot Packs were very helpful working with muscular problems. For minor cramps to full blown tie-ups, the Hot Packs provided a safe and convenient source of heat. The Cold Packs were priceless in the hot desert environment as we treated minor bumps, sore heels and people with heat stroke! They provided valuable therapy when we needed it. In the future I will always take a couple of cases of Tempra Hot and Cold Packs whenever I go to Endurance Rides.
Only in a few months, surgeons at the Cleveland Clinic are expect to become the first in the United States to transplant a uterus into a woman who lacks one, so that she can become pregnant and give birth. The recipients will be women who were either born without a uterus, had it removed or have uterine damage. The transplants will be temporary: each uterus will be removed after the recipient has had one or two babies, so she can stop taking transplant anti-rejection drugs. Uterine transplantation is a new frontier, one that pairs specialists from two fields known for innovation and for pushing limits, medically and ethically: reproductive medicine and transplant surgery. If the procedure works, many women could benefit: an estimated 50,000 women in the United States do not have a uterus. But there are potential dangers. The recipients, healthy women, will face the risks of surgery and anti-rejection drugs for a transplant that they, unlike someone with heart or liver failure, do not need to save their lives. Their pregnancies will be considered high-risk, with fetuses exposed to anti-rejection drugs and developing inside a womb taken from a dead woman. Eight women from around the country have begun the screening process at the Cleveland Clinic, hoping to be selected for transplants. One, a 26-year-old with two adopted children, said she still wanted a chance to become pregnant and give birth. She traveled more than 1,000 miles to the clinic, paying her own way. She asked that her name and hometown be withheld to protect her family’s privacy. She was 16 when medical tests, performed because she had not begun menstruating, found that she had ovaries but no uterus — a syndrome that affects about 1 in 4,500 newborn girls. She comes from a large family, she said, and always assumed that she would have children. The test results were devastating. The hospital plans to perform the procedure 10 times, as an experiment, and then decide whether to continue. Dr. Tzakis said he hoped to eventually make the operation readily available in the United States. Sweden is the only country where uterine transplants have been completed successfully — all at the University of Gothenburg with a uterus from a live donor. Nine women have had them, and four have given birth, the first in September 2014. Another is due in January. Their babies were born healthy, though premature. Two transplants failed and had to be removed, one because of a blood clot and the other because of infection.
The essential joy of being with horses is that is brings us into contact with the elements of grace, beauty, spirit, and fire. "May we be closer to our kindest humanity this holiday season. May we listen more, speak less, inspire more and control less. May we be joyful. May we evoke joy in others."
It’s Nashville Curves Week and we are starting with the wonderful BRYNN! Brynn is a non-profit educator living and working in Nashville. I met Brynn when we shot with fellow Nashville Curves Alum, Amber, and we shot the All That Glitters hair campaign for Bespoke Curry. Brynn has a sparkling personality and she’s just gorgeous. Below, read her profile and learn why being plus-size has changed her worldview! I am the Managing Director of Alumni Leadership with Teach For America Nashville. I moved to Nashville to teach in 2011, and I’ve been here since. I believe there is a powerful force of young people here. Young people who want to make this city more just. I work to make sure they have the resources and connections to do what they aspire to do. I’ve been okay with me for a long time! I’ve never believed that there was a thinner me inside just waiting to come out. However, I believe it was finding the burlesque and pin-up world in college, and seeing visual representations of Rubenesque forms presented as beautiful that I began to see my body not merely as what I’d been saddled with by genetics or circumstances, but as an integral part of my world view; something that made me myself and beautiful. I find it helpful to call it out by saying something. I make a point to communicate how these kinds of comments are rooted in diet culture. I don’t usually encounter fat-phobia via direct slights aimed at me, but rather via the ways that people around me orient to their own bodies, diets and looks. Hearing people talk about eating or exercising or their own bodies as reflections of their morality is more triggering and commonplace to me, and I find I have to name why those lines of thinking aren’t just hurtful to me, but also harmful to the person saying them. Hell yes! I’ve wanted to do something like this forever! What’s your favorite part of your body? Why? Hmm, my legs are long and thick and strong, and I appreciate them. I love the feeling of striding across a room or hallway, and I’m thankful that my legs allow me to do just that. I also got my first (and only!) tattoo on my upper left leg about a year ago. Looking down and reading the phrase “try a little tenderness” on my own body reminds me to be gentle—with myself, my loved ones and the world at large. I have SO MUCH vintage plus size clothing that I’ve collected over the years! It can be hard to come by. My most favorite piece is a pale blue, chiffon, see through dressing gown with coordinating lace. It is floor length with full sleeves, and, when I wear it, I feel like a silverscreen siren. Even if I’m just blow drying my hair I’ll wear it. What plus-size store would you like to see in Nashville? I’d like to see a brick and mortar version of Eloquii here or Madewell’s plus size clothing receiving its own store front, instead of merely existing online. In general, I’d like to see Nashville’s entire fashion community move a bit further to the weird end of the spectrum, and get a bit more playful and individualized, and that includes plus size fashion. Take more full body shots! Come back tomorrow for more profiles! Thank you Park Central Apartments for allowing us to shoot in your space. Yes Brynn…fabulous!! So, glad I wqs able to do this shoot with you.

In 1937 the Maserati brothers sold their company to industrialist Adolfo Orsi. Not long after the war was over, they decided their real interests lay in racing, and together they formed OSCA--short for the rather more cumbersome Officina Specializzata Costruzione Automobili Maserati wich was found on 1. December 1947. A variety of racing endeavors followed-- including an ambitious V12 Formula One project--but OSCAs shone in the smaller displacement classes. Frequent competitors in important races throughout Europe and America, they were driven by such notable pilots as Stirling Moss, Luigi Villoresi, and Prince Behra. While producing a wide variety of two-seat racing cars--all clothed by local coachbuilders-- OSCA was approached by Fiat to develop a larger version of OSCA's existing twin-cam engine for use in the 1500S sports car. Shortly afterward, OSCA decided to offer a street car and the natural engine choice was a 1,600-cc version of the engine developed for Fiat. The job of designing the coachwork fell to Zagato. Two versions were built: a normal roof design, as well as one of the prettiest cars of the era, the so-called double bubble coupes. While certainly a dramatic styling element, the roof-top bubbles were also practical, adding inches of headroom and incorporating vents at the rear to keep cabin temperatures down during races. These cars, with their thoroughbred racing engines and nimble chassis, were among the best-looking road/race cars of their time. Even if they hadn't been created by some of the better-known and most talented automotive engineers who ever lived, OSCA sports racers would rank high in the lists of the best post- war sports cars. Building small-bore sports racers in the 750-cc, 1,100-cc, 1,500-cc, and two-liter classes, OSCAs began winning almost immediately. The high point is without a doubt the MT4 roadster, which achieved an overall victory in the 1954 12 Hours of Sebring race driven by Stirling Moss and Bill Lloyd. Many well-known drivers did extremely well with the light, fast cars, which became the most successful 1,500-cc racers ever built. Today they easily bring nearly $500,000 as gilt- edged vintage racers and guaranteed event rides. OSCAs were clothed by the leading Italian carrozzerie and most looked as good as they went. No one ever accused the Maserati brothers of not knowing how to build great cars--they just never figured out how to make it a business. It seemed quite logical to use the money from the Fiat engine deal to make a proper road car to sell in some numbers. But as so often happens with small manufacturers, the timing wasn't quite right. Since OSCA was best at racing, it made sense that the new 1600 GT would also take to the track to enhance its reputation in the showroom. The 1600 GT was bodied by five different coachbuilders, with the most attractive and numerous being that of Zagato. With four-wheel disc brakes, fully independent suspension, strong and light ladder tube frame, a smooth, flexible engine, and clothed in the iconic "double bubble" body, it should have been everything needed for success in racing and on the road. Unfortunately, problems with homologation for both the track and street meant that deliveries were delayed almost two years. Although over a hundred examples were built, it never achieved the competition results expected and drove the company to the brink of closure.

Firebrand Candle Company originally began as a craft project during the Christmas Season of 2012. Soon after, many of the people who received candles as gifts began to ask if I had ever considered starting a candle business. After completing a business planning course through the BUILD Institute in February 2013, I launched Firebrand Candle Company. Firebrand Candles are inspired by a desire to create intimacy and connection between people, a love of compelling aromas, and a drive to bring positive light to the city of Detroit. Each soy candle is named after a Detroit street and representative of its rich history and culture. The Goal - turn the sometimes-negative conversations regarding Detroit into ones much more warm, comforting, and inviting.

Kieran Hope, 29, secured financial backing to expand his business Air Control Entech (ACE). A drug dealer caught with £300,000 of cocaine in a police organised crime operation has been given taxpayers' money to grow his drone business. Kieran Hope, 29, was handed a three-year prison sentence in 2014 and two years later founded Air Control Entech (ACE), which uses drones to conduct inspections in the oil and gas industry. He then secured financial backing from The Oil & Gas Technology Centre (OGTC), which is funded by the Scottish and UK governments, academia and industry. There are no rules against convicted criminals receiving public money. However, concerns have been raised over the organisation's refusal to disclose how much it gave to Hope's firm. The OGTC would not say how much money was invested, citing non-disclosure agreements which can keep such details from public view if commercially sensitive information is involved. Graeme Pearson, former director general of the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency and ex-Labour MSP and justice spokesman, said: "I think that where public money is being spent there is a duty on organisations to show the public how that money was used and where that money was invested." He added: "The notion that it's none of our business is unacceptable." The OGTC declined an interview request, but in a statement said Hope was "entirely transparent about his previous conviction" and that ACE "was carefully evaluated in line with our process for every investment decision and all conditions have been met throughout". In a 2018 business magazine interview, Hope, from Aberdeen, did not mention his criminality. The magazine stated that Hope bought a drone "for fun" in 2015 - the year after he was jailed for three years. Hope said this inspired him to "quit his job in the oil industry within weeks and plough £60,000 in savings and loans into a new venture, Air Control Entech". Drone company: Air Control Entech. The magazine also said that Hope has worked in various countries "before he returned to Aberdeen in late 2016" - making no mention of his prison time. Scottish Lib Dem justice spokesman MSP Liam McArthur said transparency should be expected when government money is spent to support a business. "I think the use of non disclosure agreements will strike many as inappropriate and unacceptable in these circumstances," he said. "I think the public have a right to know how public funds are being spent." At the same time as launching ACE, Hope formed sister company Air Control Global Group (ACGG) which he co-owned and ran with Liston Pacitti, 29. Pacitti was last year jailed for four-and-a-half years for endangering lives by selling so-called legal highs from shops in Arbroath and Montrose. At Dundee Sheriff Court last year, Sheriff Alastair Brown said Pacitti had exploited "a gap in the law in order to make significant amounts of money". ACGG was dissolved five months ago. Co-owners: Liston Pacitti and Kieran Hope ran Air Control Global Group. OGTC was launched in 2017 to fund technological developments to maximise North Sea oil and gas yields and more than ten years will receive £90m from the UK Treasury via the Scottish government. Hope's Aberdeen-based ACE was one of the first companies to receive funding. The company said its high-tech drones can carry out offshore inspection work more safely and at less cost than by traditional methods. Former police chief Pearson questioned these claims and why no proceeds of crime action was taken against Hope. He said: "If someone is convicted of supplying drugs and being engaged in the business of drug dealing I would have expected that asset would have been recovered and would have been returned to the taxpayers of Scotland." "I would have hoped that the agency [OGTC] would have taken further steps to ensure that the money was invested in the right places and this man might be the right person to invest in, but it should be done in a situation of openness and honesty." STV News asked the Scottish Government if it was aware of Hope's background and whether using NDAs was appropriate. Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse said: "We have no involvement in specific funding decisions made by the OGTC, who follow their own due diligence process for all applications, nor would we have any input to commercial or contractual decisions the OGTC enter into." Kieran Hope declined to be interviewed by STV News or to answer any of our questions. But after engaging a PR adviser he spoke about his conviction with an energy industry trade publication. He told Energy Voice that the £300,000 of cocaine was not his and the reason he did not appeal was that it could have resulted in an increased sentence. He said that he had been in with the "wrong crowd" and that his nine months behind bars were "very lonely". After moving to an open prison at the end of 2014 he joined a rehabilitation programme which allowed him to go out and work. He said the company which initially hired him then gave him a full-time role on his release from prison. He says this was followed by another job before he founded ACE in December 2016. "I treat people the way I like to be treated," he said. "Being up front and honest is the right way to do that. "The OGTC was really good about it. A lot of people think you do not deserve a second chance, so it's a case of proving yourself, and that's challenging. "If you mess up, it does not mean your life is over. You can come back if you work hard and are honest."
Religious books are works of fiction. At least, they were meant to be (yes, Mr. Tom Cruise). I've read every religious book in English I could find, before I was twenty. Partly because I wanted to get a hang of religion, but mostly because some of the books made entertaining reading. I'm not going to repeat my issues with religion here, but if you do care - I agree a lot with George Carlin. But I didn't come here to dig a shallow grave for religion & its fan club, I came here to praise the writings it has preserved over the ages. There is a passage of the Bible, I read often. Hidden in a history book of who begat who, is a passage of pure undiluted philosophical gold. Ecclesiastes - The book of the Preacher. The words, said to be those of King Solomon, inherited from the Talmud. As I read on, the world made more sense. and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all. and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity. seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. for all is vanity and vexation of spirit. And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? of all the labour which I took under the sun. Yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. For all the days I questioned my purpose, here was a man from ages beyond who was at the very same threshold of questioning his. To hate life because it takes away from you what you possess, to what end? To know that the world that gets your precious wisdom and labour, does not deserve it. That I'm creating a better world to only leave it behind to someone who never deserved it, because he was not as wise, as hard working, as worthy of it. But in my vanity, I choose to think all my wisdom was mine. And there in lies my pain and vexation of spirit (sic). for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him? In a very definite departure from the general tone of religious texts, the book of the preacher is very pragamatic and rarely invokes hopes or promises of a better life once you are through this one. And reciprocal altruism finds its way into an ancient book (move over Robert Trivers, Talmud just took your case). and in the evening withhold not thine hand. For those who might recognize, this is the same sentiment of action that the Gita begins with. To hold the courage to do, without heed to circumstance. Only as a work of religion would this text have survived millenia, without change and through thoughtful translations. And for that, I'm thankful.
This weekend only, we're offering a special CD and download rollback price on the full cast and enhanced audiobook releases comprising Doctor Who: The Lost Stories series three - now £10 cheaper! One of our hits of the year, the third series of Lost Stories has something for everyone. Encompassing four Doctors, it contains lost adventures featuring the First, Second, Fifth and Sixth Doctors, including an adaptation of the story which was originally scheduled to be the second ever into production: The Masters of Luxor. The joys on offer include Fifth Doctor stories The Elite (a twisty tale of the Doctor, Tegan and Nyssa's ill-fated trip to the planet Florana), Hexagora (featuring alien abduction and a proposal for the Doctor) and The Children of Seth (a tantalizing story of the search for the true origins of the mysterious Seth). All the stories star Peter Davison (the Fifth Doctor from 1981-1984) alongside companions of the time Tegan (Janet Fielding) and Nyssa (Sarah Sutton). Then it's on to Sixth Doctor Colin Baker (1984-1986) alongside regular assistant Peri (Nicola Bryant) for a trilogy of tales featuring old friends and foes. The Guardians of Prophecy brings back the Melkur from TV story The Keeper of Traken, while Power Play finds the Doctor confronted by former assistant Victoria Waterfield (the returning Deborah Watling), who isn't pleased to see him. Then, in The First Sontarans, there's a chance to learn the secret history of the warrior race. Completing the series is the aforementioned legendary The Masters of Luxor, performed by original companions William Russell (Ian) and Carole Ann Ford (Susan), followed by The Rosemariners, a lost Patrick Troughton (the Second Doctor from 1966-1969) story told by Sixties companions Jamie (Frazer Hines) and Zoe (Wendy Padbury). All of these titles can now be yours for only £80 on CD and £70 on download – but the offer ends after this weekend so act fast!

Commercial real estate company CBRE has officially launched the sell-off of the majority of Toronto’s troubled Trump International Hotel Tower and the Trump Residences at Bay and Adelaide Sts. The sale being handled by receiver FTI Consulting Canada was approved by the courts on Jan. 4. It comprises 211 hotel and 74 residential units and the building’s retail space, including the spa, the Calvin bar and upscale America restaurant. The receiver has set a minimum price of $298 million for the 65-storey, luxury tower and the sale is already receiving global interest from groups in Europe, Asia, the U.S. and some larger Canadian groups, said CBRE executive vice-president Bill Stone. “We’re encouraged by the initial response. This is a rare commodity. There are not a lot of luxury hotels available in North America at this point,” he said. CBRE has handled the sale of other prestigious Toronto hotels, including the Royal York, the Intercontinental and the Four Seasons. Stone characterized the five-star Trump Tower as a premium opportunity. “The Toronto hotel market is exceptionally strong. Last year, to the end of Oct., occupancy was up about 5 per cent to 78 per cent. It was one of the strongest years on record. Average rates were up 11 per cent up to $221. Downtown Toronto was the rate leader in the country,” he said. The bid date of Feb. 15 means the sale is expected to close this year, he said. The sale does not include 50 hotel suites and 44 condos in the building that are owned by other investors. A group of owners in the property, who claim to be the victims of misleading marketing, are suing the property’s developer, Talon International and the business organization owned by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, which manages it and licensed the use of its name on the property. The upscale Trump tower opened in 2012, after a series of delays and slow unit sales.
Tournament darkhorse team Choppers end their elimination round campaign with a bang as they won over Surangel and Sons, 84-68, Sunday in the 2012 Filipino Basketball League (FBL) played at the Palau National gym. After the score tied at 15-all in the first period, the Choppers took a 32-30 lead the close of the first half. The Choppers broke away in the third as they outscored Surangel and Sons with a 28-13 output to take a commanding 60-43 advantage. The Choppers then never looked back as they scored the win to sport an 8-8 win-loss tally going into the playoffs. Bon-Bon Pramo led the scoring clutches for the Choppers with 26 points as teammates Erwin Gonzalgo and JR Gonzales added 21 and 13 baskets, respectively. Surangel and Sons, who played with out Arnold Undecimo, Edzel Torres, Ador Hilvano, Gener Aguinaldo and playing coach Eric Manio, was led by Melvin Parinas who finished the game with 19 markers while Bong Gayongorza chipped in 17 as they tie the Ilocandia Bulls with identical 10-6 in the team standings. On the other hand, defending champion FR Spoilers drubbed the Jaguars, 125-78. After the elimination round, the league will relax for a while as they will have the All Star Weekend on September 9 while the quarterfinal round will tip off on September 23 at the same venue.
Men ( I really don’t understand them). I have my own life in Lubbock, TX. I do my own thing, work, pay my bills (on time!), involved in two organizations on campus, AND let’s not forget the purpose of all the fun; school. Yes I balance it all quite well — without a planner too– and it all seems to work out. Sometimes. Look at me text messages. Dammit. 10 text messages from my group members asking about our presentation on Friday and when to meet up. Deep breath. After replying to all of my text messages I realized an hour flew by and I still haven’t replied to my boyfriend. Naturally, I call him back and he mentions we haven’t talked in three days. Has it been that long? No, surly not? Ooh surly. He noticed. ( which is what girls want right? For their bf to be attentive to their relationship… I think?) Then he nonchalantly mentions it again three more times we haven’t talked… clearly this bothers him. Right? He’ll probably be upset I’m blogging about it. Oh well, I need to vent. And another beer. Lol! So true, the story of my life minus the bf because it got to be too much to juggle. Now that I don’t have a bf i miss it because sometimes i want to just decompress with the one i love, but then at the same time when i do have him its hard to find the time to decompress. What I’m trying to say is that it’s like a catch-22 its hard to win on both ends. Anywhoo, I liked your post.

Alaska Department of Health and Social Services Commissioner Adam Crum has invoked his authority under state law to immediately assume management of Alaska Psychiatric Institute. Commissioner Crum has contracted with Wellpath Recovery Solutions, a nationally recognized health care company with a proven record of success, to provide administrative leadership of the facility with continued oversight from the state. “During the course of recent investigations at API, we determined immediate steps were needed to protect patients and staff and ensure complete compliance with federal regulations, which also allows the facility to continue to receive federal funds,” said Crum. He recognized that serious efforts have been made towards addressing the deficiencies identified by federal and state authorities, but progress is not being made quickly enough. “While additional security measures have recently been implemented at API to better ensure patient and staff safety, contracting with Wellpath was deemed necessary to further address safety and patient rights issues and bring the facility rapidly into complete compliance with federal and state standards,” he said. Alaska state law (AS 47.32.140) allows for the commissioner to assume either temporary or permanent management of a licensed health care entity when there is reasonable cause to believe there is a danger to the health, safety or welfare of individuals receiving care from that entity. Wellpath will provide administrative oversight with the intent of correcting problems of patient and staff safety and patient rights, bringing the hospital into rapid compliance with its regulatory bodies, improving the therapeutic environment, and preparing the hospital to return to its full capacity by June 30, 2019. During the initial phase of the contract, Wellpath will bring in a team of experts to fill key leadership positions at API to support the successful completion of their mission. All API staff will remain in their positions as State of Alaska employees. Gavin Carmichael will continue as API’s acting chief executive officer. If Wellpath is successful in the first phase, the company will assume full responsibility of API after July 1, 2019. Wellpath, which merged with Correct Care Solutions and Correctional Medical Group Companies, has had success bringing facilities similar to API back into compliance with CMS and Joint Commission standards. In Massachusetts, Wellpath substantially improved conditions at the Bridgewater State Hospital after assuming operations in 2017. All hospitals managed by Wellpath are fully accredited by the Joint Commission. A press conference will take place this morning with Crum, representatives from the Alaska Mental Health Trust, the Alaska Behavioral Health Association, North Star Behavioral Health, Alaska Regional Hospital and Fairbanks Memorial Hospital. “By taking this step with the support of the health care community, the State of Alaska and our health care partners can begin to seriously address API’s longstanding problems and Alaska’s behavioral health crisis,” Crum said. Finally. This is where they located Byron Mallott, who checked into the API Hotel back in November. If he hasn’t paid room and board, and for group therapy, then the new Commish should send him packing and charge him for back rent and mental services. Things were getting a little too comfy for Mallott during his long hideout. TOOK sooo long, we owe EVERY LEVEL OF EVERY PERSON UNDER THAT ROOF…DESERVES THE MOST PROFESSIONAL TREATMENT. ONLY those who belong there should be there. Kudos to Commissioner Crum. It is about time someone stepped in and took a failing system by the horns. This didn’t start with the Walker administration; it was made terribly worse with the Walker administration. More insurance issues? What the state has never projected and proven is that there are no experts in Alaska and this new commissioner is not an expert either.. When you come in the back door, as this person has done, the problem still persists and will on into the future. If the Walker Administration had the problem all that time, four years, and this group sees an opening to stomp on the new administration, I hate to think of the future mental health of this state. We have a new governor that has not finished filling positions. Evidently, the hospitals feel like they can “bully” anyone into believing they are making the right move. The hospitals are scared. They could lose some critical funding and are pulling the “wool” over your eyes trying to make the residents of this state believe that their move is the best thing to do. Where is the new State Attorney while this junk goes on? I think I am going to like our new Commissioner of HHS! Liking someone and looking at the manipulation of that person are two different factors. This state does not know this person. secondly, the decision to put a mental health consortium at the wheel of our state says that he read the permanent dividend fund prospectus and it looked better than what he is use too. A mental health organization in touch with the prison systems of Florida and through Tennessee? Ask more questions than making that statement. Grabbing power is what he exhibited and that is not all right, not with the men, women and children that have to have services out of the API. Remember, there are no experts in this state and there never were. Do you remember Hallodon Hal? Well, everything you read in the Anchorage Daily News is right on. In 40 years plus that API has not been managed at all. Look to the Boards and the level of practiced and licensing that has been dumped on this state and the people in it. No one asks questions, you all just sit around and say its all right. No, this is not all right. I wouldn’t put the mental healthcare of the state in the hands of anyone who was too far into corrections and prison background on their resume. API is in need of Neurologists with expert related backgrounds. This guy doesn’t have it and never will. Where is this illustrious new Attorney General for the State of Alaska? Hiding in the shadows? What is the Attorney General supposed to do? Indict or sue somebody? That’ll only add more months or years of nothing getting done. How does that help the patients that are suffering now? The Attorney General prosecutes those who take advantage of the vulnerable, men, women and children in this state. He is suppose to keep his law section that handles these issues on point. Has he done that yet? Doesn’t look like it……..
So just finished watching and recording a podcast review for TRANSFORMERS:THE LAST KNIGHT, and I am just going to say, this has to be the worst Michael Bay movie yet. I can't imagine how a giant-budget movie like this got green-lit, and I'm a guy that actually enjoyed Suicide Squad when I saw it in the theater. Don't get me wrong, I don't automatically hate Michael Bay movies. I loved the first Transformers, and the second Turtles movie was pretty good too. But there is a storytelling and visual style that Michael Bay is known for, and that is usually ridiculously big explosions and effects (good) but silly or inconsistent plot writing and characters (not as good). Still, if you promise you'll show me Optimus Prime punching a giant bug-robot in the face, then I'll forgive a lot of plot holes and silliness. But this movie did not have enough robot fights or explosions to overcome the stupidity of the characters and plot and whatever the hell was supposed to be happening on screen. Not even close. It turns out that forgiveness only goes so far. THE LAST KNIGHT far. If Michael Bay was for some reason secretly trying to actually torpedo the Transformers property, well then he couldn't have done a better job. By Hera! Wonder Woman is finally here to save the DC Cinematic Universe! Cory, Suzy, and JC get pull out their bracers of deflection and review the Heroine from Paradise Isle.

Almost every day, a new approach for enhancing GXP compliance is proposed, espoused, or encouraged. Yet, our industry continues to experience problems with non-compliance. Some of these result only in adverse publicity for the recipient, though some result in potentially serious safety issues for consumers. Is there anything truly new that can help us assess potential GXP concerns and, thus, drive compliance enhancement? Perhaps not. Nonetheless, I would like to pose a new way of looking at compliance that can possibly stimulate a new way of looking at these issues. I call this the contrarian’s approach to enhancing GXP compliance. You may have heard of contrarian investors… individuals that invest in companies experience bad news. A contrarian is someone that opposes or rejects popular opinion. In the world of compliance, a contrarian is not apt to automatically believe all the good audit reports they receive or the good inspection history of the site. The contrarian’s approach to compliance involves looking for bad news, not merely looking for what is going well. The contrarian asks the truly hard questions of compliance. Let’s look at a few questions that can stimulate the contrarian’s approach. Ask these example questions of your team to generate alternative viewpoints of your own current compliance position. If we have a recall next week, what will be the issue that caused it? Could we prevent it today, if we knew it? If two individuals in your lab wanted to dry lab results, how could they do it given your current systems and protection of data? What would we have to do to prevent it? What will be the primary concern noted on the next Warning Letter your firm receives? Do we have to accept that this will happen or change we change the future if we act today? If your only job was preventing the next batch failure, what actions would you take today? What would you do if your job was literally in the balance? If an angry employee wanted to sabotage a batch of product by mislabeling a few units, how would they do it? Is it possible that one angry individual could destroy your reputation as a company? If someone wanted to hide your next stability (or sterility or environmental) failure, how would they do it? What systems have to be defeated for an individual to hide an undesired result? If an operator needed to make unauthorized and undetected changes to a manufacturing process, how would they do it? Can you devise systems to prevent it? These are only example questions. You could develop your own depending upon your operations. However, the concept is simple… if you wanted to foil your systems, could you do it and, if so, how? Or, if something bad was going to happen, what would it be and could you prevent it now, if you knew it? GXP compliance is much more than following a checklist. It involves thinking beyond the regulations and seeking deeper, more complex answers. When you actually believe all the good audit reports you get each month, you are failing to recognize the underlying potential for disaster that could await. Think about using the contrarian’s approach to identifying possibilities that until today have not been adequately considered. ← Life is simple… so, why do we make it so hard?
Switzerland does not have a CFC regime. However, according to the case law of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, companies with statutory seats located abroad, but who have little or no local substance and are effectively managed in Switzerland may be subject to Swiss income tax. For finance companies, the maximum debt allowed is 6/7 of their total assets. In addition, the FTA publishes annually safe harbour interest rates for loans granted to related parties. Interest paid on debt exceeding the maximum debt allowed and interest rates exceeding the safe harbour interest rates are requalified as a hidden dividend if paid to a shareholder or a related party. Consequently, such interest is not a deductible expense for federal and cantonal income tax purposes and is subject to withholding tax at a rate of 35% (which may be reduced under a relevant tax treaty). However, the rules set out above are merely safe harbour rules and allow the taxpayer to prove that different arm’s length debt-to-equity ratio and interest rates apply. Swiss codified tax law contains very few rules relating to transfer pricing questions. As a general rule, Swiss law states that (i) expenses of a company must be commercially justified and (ii) profits not shown in the profit and loss statement of a company must still be included in its taxable profit. Based on these general rules, Swiss tax authorities can correct intra-group transactions that are not at arm’s length. In determining whether an intra-group transaction is at arm’s length or not, the Swiss administrative practice generally follows the OECD transfer pricing guidelines. As previously mentioned, the FTA publishes yearly rules regarding safe harbour interest rates for loans and advances between related parties, in various currencies. This publication provides for maximum rates regarding loans from the shareholders or related parties to the company, and minimum rates regarding loans from the company to shareholders or related parties. It is possible to obtain an advance pricing agreement (‘APA’) with the Swiss tax authorities. In general, the cantonal tax authorities are competent for granting unilateral APAs, whereas bi- or multilateral APAs, as well as unilateral APAs regarding Swiss withholding tax, are negotiated with the involvement of the FTA. The US has comprehensive CFC rules, which have been further expanded by TCJA to include a global minimum tax of 10.5% on most CFC profits of a US corporate shareholder. Under longstanding CFC rules, a controlling US shareholder of a CFC is subject to current US taxation on any so-called Subpart F income of the CFC. Subpart F income is intended to capture what Congress perceived to be “tax haven” income, and thus includes certain interest, dividends, rents, royalties and gains, as well as certain income from sale of property and provision of services involving related parties. An exception to subpart F income is provided for income subject to a local country tax of at least 90% of US the corporate rate (now 18.9% = 90% * 21%). In addition, the TCJA introduced a new category of income captured by the CFC regime – so-called “Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income” (GILTI). GILTI consists of all income of the shareholders’ CFCs that is not subpart F income (or eligible for certain limited exceptions), to the extent that such income exceeds a 10% return on the CFC’s investment in tangible assets used in its trade or business (measured by tax basis). GILTI is fully included in taxable income of the US shareholder on a current basis in each year, with a 50% deduction provided for US corporate shareholders that results in an effective US tax rate of 10.5%. Foreign tax credits are allowed against US tax on both subpart F income and GILTI. The TCJA also added the US’s first comprehensive thin capitalization test through amended Code Section 163(j). As amended Section 163(j) limits interest deductions of corporations and other businesses to 30% of adjusted taxable income. New Code Section 163(j) applies to all debt, whether third party or intercompany, whether the lender is US or foreign, and regardless of the US corporation’s debt-equity ratio. “Adjusted taxable income” is defined generally as US taxable income without regard to interest expense, loss carryforwards, and for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2022, depreciation or amortization (i.e., EBITDA). After 2022, deductions for depreciation or amortization are no longer added back, so that interest expense is limited to 30% of EBIT. Interest expense deductions that are disallowed carry forward indefinitely. As noted above, Code Section 482 and the regulations thereunder provide a comprehensive set of transfer pricing rules. In addition, strict liability penalties apply to transfer pricing adjustments in excess of certain thresholds, unless the taxpayers has maintained contemporaneous documentation with the filing of the original tax return in a form specified by the transfer pricing regulations. Advanced Pricing Agreements (APAs) are available from the IRS on a prospective basis. In the case of transactions between the US Company and an affiliate in a treaty country, bi-lateral and multi-lateral APAs are also available involving the IRS and the other competent authorities. The FTC provides for a CFC rule that constitutes an exception to the territoriality principle: only profits derived from activities carried out in France are taxable in France. According to this rule, profits realised by an entity, which is, directly or indirectly, more than 50%, owned by a French company and which is located in a privileged tax regime country, are deemed to be received by the French company in due proportion of the shares owned and therefore, are to be taxed in France. An entity is considered to be located in a privileged tax regime country if the effective corporate tax rate applied in this country is at least 50% lower than France’s. the amount of interest paid to related parties exceeds the amount of interest received from related parties. The portion of interest paid which exceeds the highest of the three set criteria is not deductible. These rules can be extended to interest borne with respect to a bank loan when certain guarantees have been granted by affiliated companies to the lender. Anti-hybrid stipulation, which forbids the deduction of interests, if the creditor is not taxable, at least at 8.33% (i.e. 25% of the French CIT) on the financial proceeds. The FTA applies the arm’s length principle: prices applied to transactions between related parties must be similar to prices that would have been agreed upon for transactions between independent companies. If not, the FTA may presume an indirect transfer of profits from the French company to its foreign affiliate and reassess its taxable income accordingly, that is to the extent of the amount deemed to have been unduly shifted. The burden of proof regarding an indirect transfer of profits lies with the tax authorities. The rules aiming at limiting the deductibility of the interest should be deeply amended by the 2019 Finance Bill in order to transpose the Anti Avoidance Directive ('ATAD') into the French interest limitation regime. The Finance bill should limit the deduction of net financial charges (including debts subscribed with a Bank or a third party) to either 30 % of the entity's EBITDA or 3 million euros (if higher) with a calculation made at the group level. The "rabot" would be removed and the thin-capitalization rules would be deeply amended. The FTC provides for the possibility of a bilateral advance pricing agreement between multinational companies and the tax authorities which would aim at fixing the transfer pricing method to be used in cross-border transactions. The State Aid action has not dramatically changed the situation, but just increased the already thorough examination of the APA requests. Interest paid to related parties located in a tax haven or privileged tax regime jurisdictions is deductible provided that the expenses are necessary and the debt with such related party does not exceed 30% of the Brazilian company’s equity. Additionally, Brazil does also provide for CFC rules, which in general, impose taxation on undistributed profits from foreign controlled and affiliated companies. Accordingly, profits from foreign controlled companies should be considered deemed distributed to the Brazilian controlling company by December 31 of each calendar year. On the other hand, provided that some conditions are met, profits derived from foreign affiliates not located in tax haven or privileged tax regimes jurisdictions are only subject to taxation in Brazil when they are effectively distributed. Moreover, Brazilian transfer pricing rules were enacted by Law 9,430/96 and its subsequent amendments. Such rules introduced transfer pricing controls, in order to avoid undervaluation of export prices, or overvaluation of import prices, for purposes of calculating corporate income taxes (Income tax – “IRPJ” - and Social Contribution on Profits Tax – “CSLL”). Transfer pricing rules are applicable to any import or export of goods, services and rights, performed between a Brazilian company and a related party abroad, or a party located in a tax haven or privileged tax jurisdiction. There are five methods to calculate import transfer price, as well as there are four methods to calculate

The Pasadena Board of Education asked School District staff to make “stronger recommendations” for spending a new yearly influx of $7 million in revenue resulting from the passage of Measure J after reviewing an initial listing at last week’s Special Board Meeting. “We don’t want a wish list, we want something specific,” said Board Member Scott Phelps. The Board was focused on responding to a request for funding priorities from Mayor Terry Tornek, who chairs a joint ad hoc committee composed of Pasadena City Councilmembers and members of the Pasadena School Board working out how to implement Measure J. We need a game plan for how the Measure J revenues should be allocated, Tornek had said at the Ad Hoc Committee’s initial meeting last December. Before last Thursday night’s meeting, School Board Member Kim Kenne said she believed the Ad Hoc Committee wanted to get a consensus from the School Board on the use of the fresh tax revenue funds. But at the meeting, Board Member Elizabeth Pomeroy asked “What exactly does the City Council want from us?” in terms of spending plans. “This,” said new Pasadena Unified Chief Business Officer Leslie Barnes’, referring to a report she prepared for the meeting. Barnes’ report named six categories of funding—Signature programs, restoring funding of positions and funding shifts from the Fiscal Stabilization Plan; adjusting the budget for enrollment projections, backfilling lost grant funding, technology needs, and increasing reserves to District funds. The signature programs include the International Baccalaureate programs, Dual-language immersion, STEM and STEAM Magnet schools, visual and performing arts programs, math academy, and the International Academy, all of which suffered cuts over the past year. The report also recommends restoring the $750,000 Special Education reduction, as well as restoring Early Childhood TOSA teaching positions. Both Board member Phelps and Michelle Richardson Bailey spoke in favor of restoring teaching positions. Board Member Patrick Cahalan also recommended raising the $2.7 million dedicated to signature programs, to $3 million. Both PUSD President Lawrence Torres and Board Member Kimberly Kenne spoke on the danger, however, of making decisions that could not be reversed. The revised spending recommendations will be discussed at the PUSD’s next board meeting, set for January 24.

I have just finished a course of steroids due to an aggressive breakout of eczema. Stress triggers it. I have been waiting for it to arrive for over a year. I woke up one morning & both of my ears were red, swollen, hot & chronically itchy & very quickly it started to spread down my neck; I looked like Shrek’s long lost cousin. One thing I have learnt over the years is that no matter how straight I try to keep my mind my body often tells a different story. Keeping it all together is not straight forward. “How do you do it?”, they ask. “Stay strong”, they say…I say it too. It is mainly a question of how. After the initial denial of Dylan’s diagnosis (which lasted about a day) I had to skip anger, there was no bargaining power & so I went straight into some form of acceptance. It is a strange sort of acceptance because it still feels like a bad dream & to this day it shocks me to the core; I believe it always will. Nonetheless, I of course know & therefore accept that Dylan has cancer. Through this process so far there are a variety of things that I have tried to keep my mind steady. However, I do think that from a very young age certain elements of my past have set me up with a depth of strength & a certain amount of resilience. I remember aged four being subject to racial abuse whilst walking down the street with my paternal grandmother; I remember circa age seven being subject to passive racial abuse from said grandmother as she removed photos of me & other members of my family when she put her house on the market; she thought it would help the sale go through faster. In August 1990 my father (who had worked in the Middle East since 1980) was taken hostage in the Gulf war. I was seventeen, my middle sister was fifteen & my little sister was six. My father was finally released in December of the same year but not before a group of ten women flew to Iraq to ask Saddam Hussein to release their husbands. One of those ten women was my mother; she took my six year old sister with her, left me with the house keys, the car keys, her credit card & a reservation at a local hotel for my middle sister & I to have Christmas dinner if they weren’t back in time for the festive season. I was studying for my A levels & at boarding school. My middle sister was at a different boarding school just over an hour away. At one point I knew they were all still alive as I walked into the common room of my boarding house where everyone was watching the news on tv. They all turned to stare at me as I slowly realised they were looking at my parents standing next to Saddam Hussein & my little sister sitting on his knee. The entire episode was horrendous in so many ways & eventually paved the way to so many other issues that I would basically have to start another blog. This is just one of many difficult incidents that has required me to keep my head. I had no idea if I would see my mother, my father or my darling little sister ever again but I chose to keep going. I wrote a diary at the time; it was another situation that nobody could empathise with completely…I mean what do you say to a teenager in those circumstances? Years ago whilst battling the demons of a drawn out custody battle for my eldest son, Eckhart Tolle put into words what I already felt I knew. Reading his book The Power of Now calmed my fears & set my heart & mind to rest. There was nothing I could do but wait; I had no control then & I have no control now. More recently I have read books to try to find perspective. Man’s Search For Meaning by Viktor Frankl is his story of his personal struggle to survive in Nazi concentration camps. The clarity of his mindfulness in such horrific circumstances is astounding. Obviously that is not me, it is not a suggestion that one experience is worse than another; it is all relative. I cannot begin to imagine being in a concentration camp but I can relate to how Frankl chose to deal with his ordeal; I am a mother watching my child with cancer & waiting to see if he lives longer than I do. There always has been something to fight against or fight for in my life. Lying in a hospital room with my sick child watching endless episodes of Everybody Loves Raymond & Gordon Ramsey’s Kitchen Nightmares whilst wondering what his fate is was bizarre. It is not right, it is not what what I had imagined for myself; nothing can prepare you for wondering whether you need to plan a funeral for your child. It is just not normal. It hurts & it hurts hard, a hurt that cannot be described. Each day brings tiny new bits of hope so I wait for each day & see what will come; each day is tainted with an inescapable fear. This sort of existence is not healthy & I have to find ways to see each day through. What works one day may not work the next as my mind rarely settles. Wherever I am, whatever I do this ache is with me. Whoever I am with, whatever I am talking about cancer is sitting next to me & I know I have to live alongside it but I am still learning how. I feel as though I am in a tunnel with the occasional flickering lightbulb dotted around here & there, but the reality is that there is no end to the tunnel neither is there light. It narrows & it widens but I know that it will go on forever in some form or another & so I need to find ways of walking it. At school I used sport as an outlet; it helped. If only it was that simple now, age & experience bring so much more than the naivety of youth. Before Dylan was diagnosed I used to go to the gym four times a week. I stopped the moment he was hospitalised. I have thought about going back & I think I might do soon but I am scared that the moment I get on the treadmill I will not be able to stop running, I feel that it would start a torrent of tears that would never stop falling. However, I know that the endorphins released could in theory have the opposite effect, at least for a moment. I yearn for time alone but when I am alone I want company; but I don’t want company, I want to be alone. It is a conundrum to which there is no straight answer. I do what I need to do when & if I can; I need to be me so I can be the best I can for Dylan, Ruari & Nick. I have moments of fleeting anger. Anger so harsh that there is nowhere to put it; anger so potentially damaging that I could never let it out. I breathe deeper, I stand taller & I work harder. I give as much goodness as I can muster at the same time as I fight my demons. I choose to hold onto me, whoever that is on any given day; I am not who I once was. Elements of myself have disappeared only to be replaced by new elements that I do not recognise but simultaneously have to accept. Each day brings new thoughts, new chapters, new challenges but my focus remains the same; my child has cancer. I find solace in the wisdom of Maya Angelou who despite her life’s unimaginable difficulties still managed to rise. Her attitude is inspirational. Six years ago, after a minor (it seemed major at the time) complication with a couple of members of my very dysfunctional family I suffered from anxiety & had a six week course of counselling. It helped to talk to a stranger, I found it refreshing & whatever problem I thought I had is no more. I have sought counselling again since Dylan started maintenance but it has changed nothing; wherever I go & whatever I do my child has cancer. This problem is here forever. My short term memory feels diminished; shrouded in darkness as it now is it retains almost nothing, I have to work so hard to remember the smallest of things. Looking at Dylan makes me so happy & so sad all at once. Happy because I am watching him grow & develop as he is doing right now; sad because I no

MONDAY, March 18, 2019 (HealthDay News) — Higher consumption of dietary cholesterol, including eggs, is significantly associated with a higher risk for incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality, according to a study published in the March 19 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. This cardiovascular medicine theme issue was released early to coincide with the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology, held from March 16 to 18 in New Orleans. Victor W. Zhong, Ph.D., from the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, and colleagues used data pooled from six prospective U.S. cohorts (March 25, 1985, to Aug. 31, 2016) to evaluate the associations of dietary cholesterol or egg consumption with incident CVD and all-cause mortality. A total of 29,615 participants (mean age, 51.6 years at baseline; 44.9 percent men and 31.1 percent black) were included in the analysis. During a median 17.5 years of follow-up, the researchers found 5,400 incident CVD events and 6,132 all-cause deaths. For each additional 300 mg of dietary cholesterol consumed per day, there was a significantly higher risk for incident CVD (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.17; adjusted absolute risk difference [aARD], 3.24 percent) and all-cause mortality (aHR, 1.18; aARD, 4.43 percent). Furthermore, for each additional half an egg consumed per day, there was a significantly higher risk for incident CVD (aHR, 1.06; aARD, 1.11 percent) and all-cause mortality (aHR, 1.08; aARD, 1.93 percent). However, after adjusting for dietary cholesterol consumption, the associations between egg consumption and incident CVD and all-cause mortality were no longer significant (aHRs, 0.99; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.93 to 1.05 [aARD, −0.47 percent] and 1.03; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.97 to 1.09 [aARD, 0.71 percent]). “These results should be considered in the development of dietary guidelines and updates,” the authors write.

Ralph’s portrait is a study in magnificence as this condor surveys his arid surroundings, pondering his chances of staying alive. This bird has been written off for a long while now and many have said it is only a matter of time before it becomes extinct, but due to conservation action things are slowly turning around for the condor and its numbers are rising. The Great Indian Bustard is extremely likely to become extinct sooner rather than later. Its favoured habitats are dry grasslands and scrublands, and the threats to the bird are environmental degradation, habitat loss and hunting. Standing at up to 1.2m tall, and one of the world’s heaviest natural flying machines, it is an easy target for hunters and poachers alike. The red-crowned crane is now legally protected across its range. International cooperation is being sought throughout its flyway to protect the birds’ habitat – especially at breeding times. The crane is also an emblem for good fortune. It’s time for that luck to rub off on the bird itself. Parrots have always been very popular in the caged-bird trade and this has left its grubby mark upon many species, causing their numbers to dwindle. Much is being done to halt the bird traders, but the worrying trend is that for many of the traded birds their numbers are now higher in captive populations than they are in the wild. Ralph has conjured up a face of dull acceptance upon the Dwarf Olive Ibis. After all, you name it and the Ibis has faced it. Whether it be agricultural change or habitat loss through to its present-day crisis of being perpetually hunted, there is nothing it hasn’t experienced in attempts on its life and it needs all the help it can get to continue its existence. Another heavy issue at hand with the Hen Harrier, and one full of political charge. Some blame gamekeepers, some blame bad luck and some blame life itself, but the truth is that the Hen Harrier is in immense trouble in this country and is without doubt being persecuted. You can decide who by. A perfect piece of Ralphistry going on here! The Coucal is critically endangered and for no good reason is being serenaded by a non-endangered Woodlark. As the Coucal listens to the Woodlark’s attempts at replicating the Skylark’s song its worries and cares begin to dissipate. The chanteuse is never going to win a talent show but it’s a game attempt that has won its audience over. ‘Who the ’eck was Rueck?’ Well, he discovered a little shining beauty of a bird, which became his Blue-flycatcher, and I think there should be more thanks given to this man and, for that matter, all the discoverers of species. Without them, we would have no idea what lives alongside us. So thank you, Monsieur Rueck.
Lower sales for multiple medicines and a whopping charge for a big collaboration in cancer drugs drove Merck & Co. to a third-quarter loss of $56 million. But the Kenilworth, New Jersey, company beat Wall Street's muted expectations and it also narrowed, and raised, its outlook for the year. Merck on Friday reported a loss of 2 cents per share, after posting a profit of $2.18 billion, or 78 cents per share, in 2016's third quarter. Adjusted for non-recurring costs, earnings amounted to $1.11 per share. That's 8 cents better than industry analysts had forecast, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research. Merck reported revenue of $10.33 billion in the quarter, down 2 percent from $10.54 a year earlier. Keytruda sales nearly tripled in the quarter versus a year earlier, hitting $1.05 billion, and sales of hepatitis C-curing Zepatier jumped 185 percent to $468 million. But for Merck's top-selling portfolio, Type 2 diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet, sales declined 2 percent to $1.53 billion due to pricing pressure, and the Gardasil vaccine against cancer-causing human papilloma virus had a sales drop of 22 percent, to $675 million. Recent generic competition to former blockbuster cholesterol drugs Zetia and Vytorin halved their sales, to a combined $462 million. Veterinary medicines brought in $1 billion, up 15 percent. The latest results included a one-time charge of $2.35 billion for a new partnership with Britain's AstraZeneca PLC to market their existing cancer drugs and develop new ones. Merck's key medicine portfolio revolves around Keytruda, an immuno-oncology drug approved for treating several cancer types that works by enabling the immune system to better spot and kill cancer cells. Merck will now help sell AstraZeneca's Lynparza, a cancer drug from the new class called PARP inhibitors that's approved for treating ovarian and fallopian tube cancer. The companies will test those drugs and an unapproved one from AstraZeneca called selumetinib against various cancer types, separately and in combination. Merck said it now expects full-year earnings in the range of $1.78 to $1.84 including one-time items, up from its prior forecast of $1.60 to $1.72 per share. It expects revenue in the range of $40 billion to $40.5 billion, up from $39.4 billion to $40.4 billion.

The Ceram Sea or Seram Sea (Indonesian: Laut Seram) is one of several small seas between the scattered islands of Indonesia. It is a section of the Pacific Ocean with an area of approximately 12,000 square kilometers located between Buru and Seram, which are two of the islands once called the South Moluccas. These islands are the native habitat of plants long coveted for their use as spices, such as nutmeg, cloves, and black peppercorns, and the seas surrounding them were busy shipping routes. The Ceram Sea is also the habitat of several species of tropical goby and many other fish. Like many other small Indonesian seas, the Ceram Sea is rocky and very tectonically active.

A Hot Standby Node (HSN) is a node that is a member of a clique that is not configured (initially) to execute any Teradata vprocs. If a node in the clique fails, the AMPs from the failed node move to the hot standby node. The performance degradation is 0%. When the failed node is recovered/repaired and restarted, it becomes the new hot standby node. A second restart of Teradata is not needed. A node that is a member of a clique. Does not normally participate in the trusted parallel application (TPA). Can be brought into the configuration when a node fails in the clique. Eliminates the need for a restart to bring a failed node back into service. Notice in our picture that our first node is down, but that the AMPs and PEs migrated to our Hot Standby Node!
A NTP server can operate in three modes: unicast; anycast and multicast. In unicast and anycast modes, the client transmits a NTP request message to the server. The server responds with a NTP time message that the client uses for time synchronisation. In multicast mode, NTP time messages are broadcast at periodic specified intervals. Primary NTP servers can synchronise with a number of external reference time sources. The GPS (Global Positioning System) is often used to provide an accurate timing reference. There is also a number of national time and frequency radio broadcasts available. The WWVB radio time broadcast is transmitted from Colorado and covers most of the US. The DCF-77 radio time signal is broadcast from Frankfurt, Germany, and covers much of central and Western Europe. The MSF radio time signal is broadcast from Rugby, UK, and covers the British Isles and much of Western Europe. Other local time and frequency radio broadcasts include: TDF, France, and CHU, Canada. The current release of NTP is version 4. The only significant modification to the protocol between versions 3 and 4 is a slight header re-interpretation to accommodate IPv6. SNTP is a simplification of the Network Time Protocol, where the complexities of the full-blown protocol are not required. SNTP can be implemented when the high synchronisation performance of NTP is not required. The message format of the SNTP protocol is almost identical to that of the NTP protocol. However, the complex subroutines designed to maintain a highly accurate synchronised time are removed or simplified. Small computers with reduced processing power, such as micro-controllers or monitoring equipment most often use SNTP. The SNTP and NTP protocols are fully interchangeable, a SNTP client can synchronise to a NTP server without any issues. The original Network Time Protocol was introduced in RFC 958 (Request for Comments: 958). The full NTP version 3 protocol and synchronisation algorithms are described in RFC 1305. The SNTP version 4 protocols are described in RFC 2030.

An autopsy released Monday showed evidence that a transgender woman who died while in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was probably physically abused before dying, the Daily Beast reports. The woman, identified as 33-year-old Roxsana Hernández Rodriguez, traveled to the U.S. from Honduras and died nine days after she was transferred to a New Mexico facility run by CoreCivic, the news agency reported. Rodriguez died of “severe complications of dehydration superimposed upon HIV infection,” though the autopsy report also found bruising “typical of handcuff injuries” and blunt-force trauma “indicative of blows, and/or kicks, and possible strikes with blunt object,” according to the Daily Beast. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) cannot speak to the validity of the private autopsy cited by the Daily Beast; however, allegations that she was abused in ICE custody are false. A review of Hernandez’s death conducted by ICE Health Service Corps medical professionals confirmed that she suffered from a history of untreated HIV. At no time did the medical personnel treating Ms. Hernandez at Cibola General Hospital or Lovelace Medical Center raise any issues of suspected physical abuse. ICE takes very seriously the health, safety and welfare of those in our care, including those who come into ICE custody with prior medical conditions or who have never before received appropriate medical care. Any death that happens in ICE custody is a cause for concern, and the agency will continue its full review of this case according to standard protocols. Updated Nov. 26 7:55 p.m.: This story has been updated to add ICE’s response.

Marais & Maranda—What is an Animal? Tom Glazer and Dottie Evans—What is Gravity? Dorothy Collins—What’s Inside Our Earth? Episode 47: Jesus Hopping Christ Down the Bunny Trail; It’s Easter! Anyway, I find the image to be extremely appropriate. I always found Catholic imagery to be frightening as a child. It was always so bloody. I always would imagine the smell of ancient blood. Blood everywhere. Scary women’s restroom blood. It disgusted me. The church I went to was awful, don’t get me wrong, but they never hit me with bloody images–just bloody songs. But it’s not so strange, a rabbit laying a Jesus egg. It’s actually quite religiously mythological. This is precisely how religion works. The evolution of it. The rabbit, the egg, Jesus, the blood–all religious symbols. The animal fertility character giving birth to the human sacrifice. Why, what problem could you people possibly have with this? It’s all very Jesus-y. Could it be that since the blood is the rabbit’s that it makes you mad? You guys are the same types who bought Beatles records and then burned them when John Lennon observed that they were indeed bigger than Jesus in the minds of the young. Which was true. And so is this image. Christians should be the last people complaining about a bloody image. For shame. On with the playlist of this podcast. PS: This is an old post. No more comments will be accepted: all, good and bad, will be deleted. If you wish to inform me about Christ, or any other mythological figure that never existed, feel free to email me. Otherwise, be informed: I am an atheist, therefore I do not consider claims for the existence of “Christ.” I am very interested in mythology, but I don’t need any more information regarding resurrections: I have a few bibles, thank you very much, and I have all the information POSSIBLE on that subject. Thank you. Episode 46: It’s No Secret: You’re a Gullible Twit! This podcast contains several 3-and-4-letter words!

It's another nice day! This week has been the first week it's really felt like spring everyday. And with the time change, it stays lighter outside longer, too. It's been getting us really excited to start spending more time outside and working on outdoor projects. Who else is with me?? In the mean time though - yesterday I spent the day in Bloomington, Illinois for another work conference. This one was more informational than anything. A selection of holistic veterinarians gave presentations about holistic health and Young Living Essential Oils. I haven't had any experience with essential oils before, but I learned a lot about them at the conference. These oils are derived from natural herbs, and they can assist in numerous health issues. They work both physically and psychologically. Some can have calming properties, some can give you energy, some can give you confidence. Others (peppermint, for example) have heating and cooling properties, and can assist if you're having a fever. Most are so potent, all you need is one drop. Young Living is the best on the market by far, for essential oils, or so I'm told. Everyone I talked to said that there weren't really any other brands out there that compared. YL's oils are the purest of their kind, and they're selected from the best sources all over the world. Since Trent and I have started kind of a detox for the past week, I decided to get a couple of oils and try them out. When I got back from the conference I bought a couple of bottles on eBay for cheaper than you can get on the website, so I can't wait to get them and try them out. I decided to try the Lavender and Peppermint to start. Lavender is one of the most versatile oils, and can have different effects depending on where you apply it on the body. It can be calming and relaxing, or it can give you energy. Plus, it smells good! Peppermint can improve concentration and digestion, and it's very potent, so one drop is definitely all you'd need. I also bought a little sample 1 ml bottle of Valor, and a bottle of Thieves hand soap. They had this soap in the bathroom at the conference, and it smelled so good! The next thing I want to buy is the Thieves household cleaner. I just love that scent. Thieves is a blend of herbs with healing properties, so there are a bunch of hygiene and cleaning products available with this scent. Valor is strengthening and empowering. I'm getting a small sample of this, since I've never smelled it before, but thought it'd be cool to try. So crazy to think that these smells can literally change your mood and have an effect on you psychologically. I've never really been into aromatherapy before, but these vets swear by the oils and use them in their practices. They're not only for human use, but can be used for animals, too. I thought about Saleen during some of the talks, and how we can even use the oils to enhance her health and mood. Young Living actually has a whole line of products for pets, which is pretty cool. I'm excited to get my oils in the mail and start using them! Speaking of getting things on eBay, I'm continuing to sell old clothes, wallets, etc. on eBay. I've netted about $115 during March alone, but of course with shipping costs, I've only profited about half of that. That's not bad though, considering that's around 20 items that I've sold this month, and if I would have put them in a yard sale, I maybe would've made only 25 cents to $1 for each item. So, it may take a little more work to get each item to the end destination, but I'm also making a few more bucks for each item, too. And I'm slowly but surely cleaning out my closet! And what doesn't sell, we might have a yard sale in the summer, then I'll probably take what's left to Goodwill. I still have yet to sell anything on Threadflip, so I will probably discontinue trying on there and just stick to eBay, which has been 1,000 times more successful for me! And a little update about our healthy eating cleanse - as you may know, last weekend Trent and I picked up a bunch of healthy foods to start adding to our diets. We've been trying to detox a little, stay away from processed foods a little more and eat more natural and fresh food. Trent has gallstones, but hasn't gone to the doctor yet, and is trying to see what he can do for it naturally and by changing his eating habits first. He has been doing a lot better just by changing his diet, and he feels a lot better, too. I'm proud of him for changing his diet so fast, and we're trying to make it a habit and continue the healthy eating. Those are shrimp bites, but it could be worse. It's a lot better than bacon, or those horrible Chef Boyardee cans or frozen burritos he used to eat. Mixed with Bell peppers, avacado, and "veganaise". Ha. It looks like a lot of food to me, but hey, at least it's healthy.
So my golden nugget of advice to parents – prospective or otherwise – is just relax, it actually all works out. I think there’s a lot of pressure placed on would-be parents before children arrive in your home. “Are you reading the right books?” “Do you have the right crib?” And once your children are on the scene, it’s, “Are you reading with them enough?” “Are you playing with them enough?” But there is no right or wrong to-do list with parenting. I think the correct thing to do as a parent is be involved. You figure it out. You love your kids and I think that to the extent that you’re able, you’re always going to make the right decision for them. So yes, you can always over prepare and you can put a great deal of stress on yourself, on your partner. But if you don’t prepare, your kids will live.

Kamisama Kiss (Kamisama wo Hajimemashita), the manga by Julietta Suzuki, received an anime adaptation in 2012 and a second series in 2015. The story is set in the Old Town Warehouse District in Kawagoe City, Saitama prefecture where the atmosphere of the Edo period is retained to this day. The city is a popular tourist destination and conveniently situated less than an hour’s train ride from Ikebukuro in Tokyo. I’m going to show you places which appeared in Kamisama Kiss in Kawagoe. The openings of both the first and second season of Kamisama Kiss feature the Saitama Resona Bank building which stands in the Warehouse District. The three-story Renaissance-style building with the impressive green tower was constructed with reinforced concrete in 1918. It’s a landmark of Kawagoe and stands among the two-story old warehouses and merchant houses. The Taisho Roman Street appeared as the school road of protagonist Nanami. The 200m-long street first appeared in the second episode of the first season and is situated behind the Warehouse District. During the Taisho period, Japan underwent a certain degree of Westernization and Western-style buildings became popular. The influence of Western culture was evident in not only architecture, but also art, fashion, literature, and everyday life styles, a change which was termed as Taisho Roman. The street is paved with granite stone. The building of Kawagoe Chamber of Commerce, which is reminiscent of an ancient Greek temple, stands at the end of the street. The north end of the Taisho Roman Street is marked by the building of Kawagoe Chamber of Commerce, which used to be occupied by a bank. There is a red pillar box in front of the building. It’s an old-fashioned post box, which used to be everywhere in Japan until 40 years ago, but are hardly seen nowadays. You only can see it in few designated places for conservation. The building with white flags at the far left is the amami dokoro which Nanami visited in the third episode of the first season. ‘Amami dokoro’ are traditional cafés in Japan where you enjoy Japanese sweets with green tea. The middle of the three lined old clay warehouses with white flags is the model of the amami dokoro in the series. It’s actually a restaurant called Hayashiya, which serves grilled eel dishes. Kawagoe was famous for its eel dishes until the Edo era, so there are a couple of popular grilled eel restaurants to this day. Hayashiya is one of them and its customers wait in line at lunchtime. A symbol of Kawagoe is Toki no Kane (the bell of time), which appeared in the openings of both the first and second season, as well as in some of the anime episodes. It’s a bell tower originally built in the Edo period about 400 years ago. In that period, time was measured by the movement of the sun. The bell in the tower chimes at specific times in the day to tell the time to the people in Kawagoe. The present tower is the fourth generation which was rebuilt after the previous one was destroyed by the Great Fire of Kawagoe in 1896. It’s a three-stories tall 16m-high wooden structure, and its chimes currently ring out four times a day: at 6:00, 12:00, 15:00, and 18:00. The chimes are a popular tourist attraction that allows them to feel the atmosphere of the Edo period, and are part of the ‘100 Best Sound Sceneries in Japan’ to be protected by the Ministry of the Environment.

Australia’s large firms and tech startups will benefit from a new visa scheme, the aim of which is to offer a permanent residency to migrant workers just after three years. Known as the Global Talent Scheme, it is being opened on a trial basis following the expiry of the 457 visa program on 18 March. To appear in two tranches for tech startups and renowned businesses, the new visa will be tried out from 1 July. A pathway to permanent residency will be issued to the holders of the four-year temporary skills shortage (TSS) visas after three years when the government trials the new visa for one year. It is said that companies with more than AUD4 million in annual revenues will be given the permission to sponsor highly-skilled and experienced people for a job paying over AUD180,000 to arrive in Australia. The employers will have to show that existing workers of Australia will profit through this skills transfer. Moreover, the sponsoring businesses will have to show evidence that they usually recruit and train locally. In addition, STEM startups will be able to sponsor experienced overseas individuals, who have niche technology skills, after they are acknowledged by a start-up authority. They also have to show that Australians will be given the first priority during the recruitment process. Innes Willox, Ai Group Chief Executive, was quoted by International Business Times as saying that the new visa trial will present Australia an opportunity to attract the best talent from all over the world. He felt its emphasis on STEM skills and niche talent will be a godsend to several Australian businesses and startups, which are finding it tough to find suitable workers for these positions. Willox is of the view that this visa will acknowledge the global character of businesses, and the new pilot’s emphasis on enticing talent is a win-win for businesses as well as the economy. He said in a statement that the application process, which has been guaranteed to be simpler and quicker, is the USP of the visa pilot, particularly because delays have been on the rise for the former 457 visa approvals. If you are looking to migrate to Australia, talk to Y-Axis, the world’s No.1 immigration and visa company, to apply for the new visa.
Lowering the temperature of your water heater's temperature to 120 degrees F can save 3 to 5 percent in energy costs per year. 1 What Is a Carbon Footprint and Reduce It? 4 How Do I Measure a Carbon Footprint? Carbon footprint refers to the impact your daily activities have on the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Transportation choices and burning fossil fuels for heat and electricity are two major contributors to your carbon footprint. Simple strategies can help you immediately reduce your footprint in these areas. In addition to these instructions, follow the principles of reducing, reusing and recycling and consider how your diet and the products you buy contribute to greenhouse gases. For a comprehensive look at your carbon footprint, take an online quiz like the ones offered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or the Global Footprint Network. Install a programmable thermostat and lower or raise the temperature by 10 to 15 degrees F whenever you are gone for the day. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, regularly setting back your thermostat for eight-hour stretches will result in energy savings of up to 10 percent annually. (See References 3) Adjust the thermostat even when you're at home --- according to the California Energy Commission, setting the thermostat higher in warm weather will save you 1 to 3 percent for every degree above 72 degrees F (see References 4). Get a home-energy audit to fully assess the ways in which you can make your house more energy-efficient. Many utility companies offer free audits; you can start your own assessment by visiting the U.S. Department of Energy's "Home Energy Assessments" webpage. Avoid placing lamps outfitted with CFL bulbs where children or pets can easily knock them over. CFL bulbs contain a small amount of mercury --- if the bulbs break, the mercury can escape, which can be hazardous to your health. Pearson, Owen. "How to Reduce Your Carbon Footprint Now."

6:1 Attend ye not to do your justice before men, to be seen to them; and if otherwise ye have no reward from your Father which in the heavens. 6:2 When therefore thou doest alms, thou shouldst not sound the trumpet before thee, as hypocrites do in the assemblies, and in the streets, that they might be praised by men. Verily I say to you, They have their reward. 6:4 That thine alms might be in secret; and thy Father, who seeing in secret, shall give back to thee openly. 6:5 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites; for they love in the assemblies, and in the corners of the broad ways to stand praying, so that they might appear to men. Verily I say to you, that they have their reward. 6:6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy store-house, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father which in secret; and thy Father who seeing in secret shall give back to thee openly. 6:7 And praying, talk ye not vainly as the nations; for they think that by their profaneness of speech they shall be listened to. 6:8 Therefore make not yourselves like them: for your Father knows of what things ye have need before ye ask him. 6:9 Therefore so do ye pray: Our Father which in the heavens, Let thy name be declared holy. 6:10 Let thy kingdom come. Let thy will be as in heaven also upon the earth. 6:11 Give us this day our bread sufficient for sustenance. 6:12 And let go to us our debts, as we let go to our debtors. 6:13 And thou shouldst not lead us into temptation, but deliver thou us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen. 6:14 For if ye let go to men their faults, your Father which in the heavens will also let go to you. 6:15 But if ye should not let go to men their faults, neither will your Father let go your faults. 6:16 And when ye fast, be not, as hypocrites, of gloomy aspect: for they conceal their faces that they might appear to men fasting. Verily I say to you, That they have their reward. 6:18 That thou mightest not appear to men fasting, but to thy Father which in secret; and thy Father which in secret, will give back to thee openly. 6:20 But treasure to you treasures in heaven, where neither moth, nor gnawing destroy; and where thieves dig not through, nor steal. 6:22 The light of the body is the eye; if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be light. 6:24 None can serve two lords: for either he will hate one and love the other; or hold firmly to one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. 6:25 For this I say to you, Be not anxious about your soul, what ye eat, and what ye drink; nor about your body, what ye put on. Is not the soul more than food, and the body than dress? 6:27 Which of you, being anxious, can add one cubit to his size? 6:29 And I say to you that neither Solomon in all his glory was surrounded as one of these. 6:30 And if the grass of the field, being this day, and to morrow cast into the furnace, God so clothes much rather you, ye of little faith! 6:31 Therefore be ye not anxious, saying: What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, What shall we put round us? 6:32 For all these the nations seek for; for your heavenly Father knows that ye have need of all these. 6:33 But seek first the kingdom of God and his justice, and all these shall be added to you. 6:34 Therefore should ye not be anxious about the morrow: for the morrow shall be anxious about the things of itself. Sufficient for the day its evil.

The hunters reportedly lured Cecil out of Hwange National Park, where it is illegal to kill wildlife, at night. Cecil was shot with a bow and arrow. The wounded lion didn't die until 40 hours later, when the hunters tracked him down and shot him with a rifle. They then skinned and beheaded him. The Zimbabwe Professional Hunters and Guides Association confirmed that Cecil was killed outside the park on private land, and an investigation is ongoing into the legality of the hunt. The legend of Cecil started about three and a half years ago, when the then-10-year-old lion was kicked out of his pride, beaten by younger, more powerful males. Hunters argue that as loners, prideless male lions aren't as important to sustaining lion populations. But Cecil wasn't finished. He soon teamed up with another lone male named Jericho, and the lions regained control of the region's two prides, one of which consists of three lionesses and seven cubs under seven months old. The loss of Cecil most likely spells the end of Jericho's reign, and the possible loss of the pride's cubs. Jericho, as a single male, will be unable to defend the two prides and cubs from new males that invade the territory. This is what we most often see happening in these cases. Infanticide is the most likely outcome. Last week, the lion, Cecil, crossed just outside the park&apos;s border, and a bow hunter shot the 13-year-old big cat. The hunters reportedly tracked down the wounded lion two days later, killing him with a rifle. The Zimbabwe Professional Hunters and Guides Association confirmed that Cecil was killed outside the park on private land, meaning the killing wasn&apos;t illegal. The legend of Cecil started about three and a half years ago, when the then-10-year-old lion was kicked out of his pride, beaten by younger, more powerful males. Hunters argue that as loners, prideless male lions aren&apos;t as important to sustaining lion populations. The loss of Cecil most likely spells the end of Jericho&apos;s reign—and the possible loss of the pride&apos;s cubs. "Jericho as a single male will be unable to defend the two prides and cubs from new males that invade the territory," Loveridge said. "This is what we most often see happening in these cases. Infanticide is the most likely outcome." Please demand justice for Cecil the lion, and stop trophy hunting in Africa once and for all! Bad news I'm afraid - charges have been dropped against the hunter who charged Palmer $50,000 to help kill Cecil. It's more important than ever that you share this petition with your friends on Facebook. We will continue to fight for justice. I SENT JACOB ZUMA, PRESIDENT OF SOUTH AFRICA, AN EMAIL TO BAN ALL TROPHY HUNTING IN AFRICA. I MADE THIS PETITION, AFTER THAT VERY SAD DAY CECIL LION WAS KILLED. NOW I REALIZE IT SHOULD HAVE SENT PETITION TO JACOB ZUMA INSTEAD OF MUGABE. HE HAS DONE SO MUCH MORE THAN HIM IN CONSERVATION, I'M PRAYING ZUMA WILL GET MY EMAIL, AND REPLY BACK. WE ARE ALL THE VOICES, AND WILL CONTINUE TO STAND STRONG FOR ALL THESE PRECIOUS ANIMALS THAT DESERVE TO LIVE AND BE HAPPY WITH THEIR FAMILIES. I APPRECIATE ALL SIGNING AND SHARING PETITION FOR CECIL. PLEASE KEEP SHARING. WE CAN END POACHING FOR GOOD. OUR VOICES ARE STRONG AS ONE.
Abstract : In this talk, we are interested in a transmission problem between a dielectric (the vacuum) and a metamaterial. The question we consider is the following : does the limiting amplitude principle hold in such a medium ? This principle defines the stationary regime as the large time asymptotic behavior of a system subject to a periodic excitation. An answer is proposed here in the case of a two-layered medium composed of the vacuum and a particular metamaterial= (Drude model). In this context, we reformulate the time-dependent Maxwell’s equations as a Schrödinger equation and perform its complete spectral analysis . This permits a quasi-explicit representation of the solution via the \generalized diagonalization" of the associated unbounded self-adjoint operator. As an application of this study, we show finally that the limiting amplitude principle holds except for a particular frequency, called the critical frequency, characterized by a ratio of permittivities and permeabilities equal to -1 across the interface. This frequency is a resonance of the system and the response to this excitation blows up linearly in time.
Elfenworks Productions, LLC proudly managed all aspects of virtuoso violinist Aaron Rosand’s web presence for about a decade, until the launch of his new retrospective autobiography, at the end of 2013, when it made sense to bring the web presence closer to home. Concurrent to our work supporting Maestro Rosand, we were also supporting VOX Music Group as their webmaster. It was during this time that we provided additional assistance to VOX in managing the successful releases of the two-CD set Aaron Rosand in Norway, as well as Rosand’s first downloadable CD for sale, an MP3 version of his Brahms Hungarian Dances CD. Lauren Speeth, Director of Elfenworks was greatly responsible for promoting my career over a ten year period. Her extraordinary computer skills and creative ability made my first website a model for many artists who followed. It won several awards and was instrumental for increased CD and DVD sales resulting from this website. The films produced by Elfenworks will remain as a lasting testimony of a period in my artistic life. If one is judged by one’s friends and clients, we will surely continue to bask in the glow of having worked with the legendary maestro for years to follow.

Home / Spiritual Growth / Destinations / Should I marry or stay single? You can’t ask that! You’re only allowed to ask easy questions. Just kidding. Actually the Bible offers some excellent counsel on this question. Let’s start with the original plan. At the beginning of the Bible, we read that God designed human beings as male and female and that men and women were to connect with each other in a relationship that was so close and deep that they said to “become one flesh.” Genesis 2:24. Jesus confirmed this and warned against those who would separate husband and wife because God had united them. Matthew 19:4-6. So God’s general plan for people is that they marry. Great leaders in the Bible were married: Moses, Peter and the other apostles (Exodus 2:21; 1 Corinthians 9:5). However, there are some individuals that God calls to live a single life. He told the prophet Jeremiah to remain single (Jeremiah 16:2). Jesus and Paul were both single throughout their ministry. So should you marry? For most followers of Jesus the answer is YES! But how do you know if you are part of the “most” or if you are one of the exceptions? First, pay attention to God’s ideal for marriage: one flesh. God intends that in marriage husband and wife share together deeply spiritually, physically, emotionally. If you are thinking of marrying someone who does not share you relationship with God, your marriage will always be hindered. You may be able to make it work, but you won’t be able to experience the deep spiritual and emotional intimacy that God intends for marriage (and that nearly every human wants). Paul wrote that we “should not be unequally yoked to unbelievers.” (2 Corinthians 6:14). This statement highlights that followers of Jesus have different priorities, different values from other people. Any real partnership calls for unity in just these kinds of things. Loneliness and romance can blind us, so if you are thinking about marriage, consult with others who know you well and care for you. That may include your parents, mature friends, your pastor. And go slow in sharing affection physically. The more intimate you are physically, the harder it will be for you to pay attention to the spiritual, emotional and rational aspects of your relationship. You may think that living together will help you figure out if you are compatible. It doesn’t work. Eighty percent of marriages fail if the couple lives together before marriage. Waiting for sexual union until after marriage will help you experience God’s ideal of a happy, lasting marriage.

Veronica Weatherhead, a nurse who visited Togo on Mercy Ships and her sister Rebecca Bond who has been collecting donated teddy bears for Veronica to take with her. Veronica Weatherhead of Royston spent seven weeks on a hospital ship in Togo run by the charity Mercy Ships, helping ill and disabled patients. Since she returned, her sister Rebecca Bond of Bassingbourn has been collecting knitted teddy bears which will be sent to children in places such as Togo, which has no healthcare system. Mrs Bond said: “Veronica showed us some photos and told me about her experience. I can’t help on the nursing side of things, so I started asking friends to knit teddies. The next step for the bears is to take them over to the Mercy Ships headquarters in Stevenage, before they are packaged up and sent to the children. Mrs Weatherhead, a nurse at Addenbroke’s Hospital in Cambridge, found out about the Mercy Ships through the Royston Rotary Club. “It was great living there. They are beautiful people, and there was a lovely, atmosphere. Mrs Weatherhead tended to patients who suffered from cleft pallets, bow-legs, tumours, cataracts and club feet, as well as meeting the country’s president. She is due to return to Africa next March, when the ship will be docked in Sierra Leone. To contribute, or for more information on the teddy bear collection, call Rebecca Bond on 01763 246556.

I had a great weekend shooting the local music festival Ferryfest at Reedham with the picturesque Norfolk broads as the backdrop. Despite the cold, wind and rain they had a great turn out with some amazing bands such as Dumdfoundus, Slightly Offensive Steve, Hemmingway and Killamonjambo (to name but a few) to lift the crowds spirits. This was the events third year and its getting bigger and better! Lets hope theres many more to come!! These shots were all taken with the fuji X-pro 1 using the 35mm f1.4 and the 18mm f2, the low light capabilities are amazing and with the fast lenses it was a great camera to use and more than up to the job of capturing the bands.

Chimbu province in Papua New Guinea is in mourning over the death of its governor, Father Louis Ambane. Reports say Father Ambane, who was in his 60s, died on Saturday from liver fibrosis. Father Ambane was diagnosed with the disease six months ago and had recovered after receiving treatment in Australia. But he suffered a relapse two weeks ago and was initially admitted to Kundiawa hospital. Father Ambane died while he was being airlifted from Kundiawa to the Pacific International Hospital in Port Moresby. He was serving his second term in office after being first elected in 1997.
Forces of weathering and erosion are constantly reshaping the Earth’s surface. Weathering is a group of natural processes that break rock into smaller pieces over time. Erosion occurs when rock and soil are transported. The two types of weathering are mechanical and chemical. Mechanical weathering is the physical decomposition of rocks. Chemical weathering is the decomposition of rocks by chemical reactions. 3. How Is Rock Eroded? Rock can be eroded by many forces such as blowing wind, running water, ocean waves, flowing ice and gravity. These forces all contribute to sculpting the Earth’s landscape.
Best episode so far. I didn't get on with the first series- too many plots that went nowhere, not enough character, not enough atmos and a captain that you couldn't trust. This series is great so far and with J Frakes at the helm on this one the quality is no surprise.
Our neighbor Andrea brought us some cupcakes and these seem to be still very popular with Keagan. Keagan got from his godfather a very sturdy digital camera from Fisher Price. He’s completely in love with it and whenever something remotely exciting happens he says “I have to get my camera!”. What he didn’t get yet is the fact, that not always in life bigger means better. He is really proud that his camera is so big and pities me for my very compact one :-). On the other hand his camera is waterproof and mine isn’t and so he offered me very kindly that I could use it whenever I feel the need to take underwater photos. and this is little series of photos he shoot of our christmas eve dinner with my sister Sarah and my mother. He definitely has talent! Thank you Catriona for pointing me to this article. Keagan has found the last heap of snow and had to master it with his bike. And a diligent one indeed! After a very busy day at work I picked Keagan up and we went to the forest to see the really lovely Unter-Weg-s walk. When we came back Susanna had prepared her amazingly delicious homemade gnocchi with a creamy basil tomato sauce. I can’t really imagine how a Monday could get better!

A dukun is an Indonesian-Malay term for shaman. In Malaysia, they are referred to as bomoh. Their societal role is that of a healer, spirit medium and tradition experts. In common usage the dukun is often confused with another type of shaman and it is often mistranslated into English as witch doctor or medicine man. The dukun is the epitome of the kejawen or kebatinan belief system indigenous to Java. Beneath the thin superficial practice of Islam, very strong and ancient beliefs of animism, ancestor worship, in the pre-colonial past, dukun were exempt from paying taxes, as with Hindu priests and Buddhist monks. Many highly prominent and highly educated Indonesians and Singaporeans, even those with Western doctorate and masters levels degrees will still consult dukun or soothsayers. Dukun are most common on the island of Java, though the island of Madura is especially feared for being very powerful practitioners of dark magic, the Dayak people of Kalimantan are feared for their use of dukun when head-hunting. In Sabah, the Kadayan community are renowned for their dukun who are said to look waif-like with red eyes, in common practice, a dukun is consulted when a person perceives they have an issue that has a supernatural or paranormal association. If a dukun is not known to the individual, their family or friends, word of mouth often creates a situation where the dukun will appear as if summoned, the dukuns knowledge is passed down orally, but the specific customs differ from one community to another. Initiates may voluntarily decide to learn the craft, or the position might be inherited. Proto-Malay dukun often serve the role of both shaman and village chief, known as a tok batin. Dukun who inherited their knowledge from their parent or grandparent is held in higher esteem than one who served as another dukuns disciple, typically the initiation ritual involves meditation at a mountain, cemetery or some other location away from people. In some communities, such as the Kadayan of Sabah, dukun are required to learn silat before they can be initiated, the purpose is both for the purpose of self-defence and for the spiritual training. The slametan is the communal feast from Java, symbolizing the social unity of those participating in it. Clifford Geertz considered it the core ritual in Javanese religion, in particular the abangan variant, the feast is common among the closely related Javanese and Madurese people. A slametan can be given to celebrate almost any occurrence, including birth, death, moving to a new house, depending on the intention, the mood and emphasis may vary somewhat, but the main structure is the same. This is what the host intends for himself and his guests, by experiencing the egalitarian structure of the slametan and the petitions of supernatural protection from spirits. In Geertzs fieldwork in Mojokuto in the 1950s, he found that costs of slametans varied from 3 to 5,000 Indonesian rupiahs, depending on the type, slametans are generally held in the evening, after evening prayer is finished. The date is determined either by the occurrence it is celebrating, the guests, always men, are always close neighbors, and the selection of guests is based entirely on proximity, and not whether they are friends or relatives. They are called by a messenger of the host only five or ten minutes before the slametan is to begin, when they arrive, the guests sit on floor mats around the food which has been placed in the center, while incense fills the room. The ceremony begins with a speech in high Javanese. During pauses in the speech, the audience responds with solemn inggih, following the speech, somebody present gives an Arabic chant-prayer. Many will not know how, but the host makes sure that there had attended a religious school. Fragments of the Koran, especially the al-Fatiha, are most commonly used, at pauses the audience says amen. The prayer leader receives a small payment, at last, the food is served. While the ceremony is strictly for men, the food preparation falls upon the women in the family, each guest receives a cup of tea and a banana-leaf dish containing each sort of food in the center of the room. The food is fancier than average, and each variety has a symbolic meaning, the host himself does not eat, nor does he serve the food, which one or two of the guests does. A rite of passage is a celebration of the passage which occurs when an individual leaves one group to enter another. It involves a significant change of status in society, in cultural anthropology the term is the Anglicisation of rite de passage, a French term innovated by the ethnographer Arnold van Gennep in his work Les rites de passage, The Rites of Passage. The term is now fully adopted into anthropology as well as into the literature, in English, Van Genneps first sentence of his first chapter begins, Each larger society contains within it several distinctly separate groupings. In addition, all these groups break down into still smaller societies in subgroups, the population of a society belongs to multiple groups, some more important to the individual than others. Van Gennep uses the metaphor, as a kind of house divided into rooms, a passage occurs when an individual leaves one group to enter another, in the metaphor, he changes rooms. Van Gennep further distinguishes between the secular and the sacred sphere, many groups in modern industrial society practice customs that can be traced to an earlier sacred phase. Passage between these requires an ceremony, or ritual hence rite of passage. He is able to find some universals, mainly two, the separation between men and women, and the magico-religious separation between the profane and the sacred. He refuses credit for being the first to recognize type of rites, in the work he concentrates on groups and rites individuals might normally encounter progressively, childbirth, betrothal, marriage and the like. He mentions some others, such as the passage, a crossing of borders into a culturally different region. Rites of passage have three phases, separation and incorporation, as van Gennep described, in the first phase, people withdraw from their current status and prepare to move from one place or status to another. The first phase comprises symbolic behavior signifying the detachment of the individual or group, from an earlier fixed point in the social structure. There is often a detachment or cutting away from the self in this phase. For example, the cutting of the hair for a person who has just joined the army and he or she is cutting away the former self, the civilian. Robert Ranulph Marett was a British ethnologist. He was an exponent of what is called the Evolutionary School or more precisely the British Evolutionary School of Cultural anthropology. Marett focused primarily on the anthropology of religion, asserting with Tylor the evolutionary origin of religions he modified Tylors animistic theory to include the concept of mana. His anthropological teaching and writing career at Oxford University spanned the earlier 20th century prior to the Second World War and he trained many notable anthropologists. He was a colleague of John Myres and through him connected to the world of Aegean archaeology. Marett was the son of Sir Robert Pipon Marett and Bailiff of Jersey. He was born in Saint Brélade and he belonged to a family, originally named Maret, that settled on Jersey from Normandy in the 13th century. The Saint Brélade branch came finally to build a house for themselves. They were substantial in wealth and position, contributing high-level magistrates to the government of Jersey, roberts father had been Bailiff of Jersey. He was one of the founders of La Patrie, a patriotic newspaper, Philip Maret, 3rd son of the 2nd Seigneur of La Haule, born in 1701, had emigrated to Boston, where he became a merchant captain. His subsequent family participated in the American Revolution and the War of 1812, roberts mother, Julia Anne, bore the name of Marett before marriage. She was one of the eight children of the Janvrin sisters, Esther Elizabeth and Maria Eliza, by one Philip Marett, Philip was a name often used by the Maretts. Thus Julia Anne was only a distant cousin of her husband, the house, came into Robert Ranulphs possession through his mother. Her mother was Maria Eliza Janvrin and she and Robert Pipon had four children, Robert Ranulph, Mabel Elizabeth, Philippa Laetitia, and Julia Mary. Robert Ranulph may have been a son, but he had three sisters and a large number of cousins. He came from a large-family environment, nature in her kindness endowed him with good brains, good memory, lively imagination and abounding physical vigour. Divination is the attempt

“Everywhere, education and health receive maximum spending. However, in our country, it is among the least. Nobody understands the priority,” education activist Vivek Velankar said. PUNE: While the National Education Mission received allocation of Rs 38,572 crore, education activists are disappointed as there is almost no mention of special allocations or projects for school education in the Union Budget 2019. Considering the government’s promises in promoting skill-based education and the much-discussed lack of trained teachers in the schools, it was expected the Budget will address these aspects. Expressing disappointment, Ravindra Talpe, tribal activist, said all that can now be done is wait for the regular Budget. “This Budget was made totally in political interest. I still believe that education should not be neglected even in an interim budget,” he added. Parent activist Anubha Sahai of India Wide Parents Association said almost all departments in the education sector cite lack of funds and manpower, and yet, the Budget has no concrete provisions. The Budget envisaged a national programme on ‘Artificial Intelligence’, which would be catalysed by establishment of National Centre on Artificial Intelligence. Nine priority areas were identified and a National Artificial Intelligence portal will be developed soon. While this new initiative has been proposed, there has been decline in the funds allocated to the IITs, IISERs, IIMs and statutory and regulatory bodies like University Grants Commission (UGC) and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE).
It’s all about the cut! Choosing the right cut will determine taste, texture and quality. The best cut you can get from the butcher is Prime choice. It should have some marbling, or fat. The fat helps create a savory flavor within the meat. Be careful not to get a cut with too much marbling however, because too much fat could cause flare up on the grill, thus burning the steak. The size of the cut also matters. The best size steak would be between 1-1 ½ inch thick. For more on picking the right cut, read this article. The way you season a steak will help navigate the ultimate flavor, according to Shula’s Steak Houses. Seasoning it after it’s grilled will give you the strongest seasoning flavor, but the least tasty meat. If you put seasoning on right before grilling the steak will give you a decent seasoning flavor, but without any intricate meat flavor. The best way to get the most flavor is to season the steak a little while before grilling. You should only use salt and pepper, or if you’re feeling frisky, use some steak seasoning salt. Also, leave the steak out at room temperate for at LEAST 5 minutes before putting it on the grill. As you’re getting ready to put the meat on the grill, remember, you will want the grill HOT! Preheat your grill longer than you normally would with the lid down. If possible, create 2 different zones: essentially one burner on, and one off. After your grill is done heating up, scrub the grease from the grates using a grill brush. Clean grates transmit more heat to the meat and create a cleaner flavor. Put the steak on the hottest part of the grill and close the lid. Check out this site to find some more information on perfect grill technique. Most people cook the steak so it is flipped only once on each side, and flipped at a 90 degree angle to create those beautiful looking grill marks. Next time you’re grilling a steak, try it this way instead: flip it frequently; about every minute or so. It will cook the meat more evenly, quicker and create a nice, savory, brown crust. For more on this flipping technique, read LA Times’ article here. Cook it to the perfect temperature. There are 2 different ways to check your steak for its perfected doneness. The best chefs use the 5-finger rule: Hold your hand open. Feel the soft, fleshy spot of your palm underneath your thumb. When your hand is open, the way that fleshy spot feels is the way the steak will feel at rare. Keep touching that fleshy spot beneath your thumb as you move your other fingers along to gauge your temperature. Touch your thumb to each tip of each finger all the way to your pinky for well-done steaks, each fingertip being the varying degree of doneness. The second method is just to simply use a digital thermometer, placed into the center of the meat. At rare, the temperature will be 125 degrees. Increase that number by ten degrees for each degree of wellness, all the way up to 165 degrees for well-done. If you cut into the steak too soon after it is done cooking, the meat loses its juices. If you let it rest for at least five minutes, it will allow the pressure inside the meat to go down and the juice to distribute itself through the meat. Put in on the cold side of the grill, or a wire rack instead of a plate to prevent the bottom of the meat from becoming soggy. Take these tips, a great cut of meat, and start grilling!
This will be a very quick post on how to check if an object / character / player / car / vehicle or whatever kind of 2D object is grounded or not. To do this we use the OverlapCircle static function of the Physics2D class. Of course there are other functions, however, for the purpose of demonstration we use this function. You can follow the same steps to achieve the same using the other function. To use the assets that we are using in this post, download the Sprites folder from here. Extract and add the sprites into your project. 1. Create a New Scene. Drag and drop the ground sprite onto the Hierarchy, this should create a ground object. Position it at (0, -4, 0). Set the Scale to (7, 3, 1). 2. Add a PolygonCollider2D component to this ground object. 3. Add a New Layer named Ground and set the layer of the ground object as Ground. 4. Drag and drop the Wheel sprite onto the Hierarchy just like you did for the ground sprite. Now, you should have a Wheel object in the Scene. Add a CircleCollider2D component to it. 5. Now, while the Wheel object is selected in the Hierarchy, create an Empty gameobject so that it is created at the same position as the Wheel object. If it is not created at the same position, change it's position the wheel's position. Rename the object to GroundHitCheck and make it the child of Wheel object. The Physics2D.OverlapCircle takes three parameters in the above function which are the empty object's position, which is (0, 0) in our case. Note that it is a Vector2. The second parameter is the radius to which the circle extends. It is set to 1 as the radius of the wheel is also 1. The third parameter is the list of layers that we should check for overlap. Not to forget, this function returns a boolean. 7. Attach the above script to the Wheel object. Drag and drop the GroundHitCheck object into the field Ground Check 1. Select the Ground layer from the ground_layers dropdown. We are done with the setup and coding. All that is left is to test and see if it works. Click on the play button or hold ctrl+p to test the scene and check how the console displays true / false when the wheel is moved towards the ground and taken away from it. This is how you check if the object is grounded for an object that is circle shaped, if you have a rectangle or a square shaped object you would want to use the OverlapArea function which accepts two Vector2 parameters (two Vector2 for the two diagonal ends of the square or rectangle) and a layer_mask parameter just like the OverlapCircle. To use it you would simply create two empty gameobjects and place them at two diagonal ends of your object or place them at points where you want to raise a GroundHit flag when those position hit the ground.
Most Bluefield’s residents would now be aware that the proposed cell tower behind properties at the Donelson Pike entrance will be moved to another location outside of Bluefields. There are many people to thank for this very happy outcome and I will be naming some of those great folks that helped us achieve this outcome but I wanted to share a brief summary of one of the most hectic, stressful and ultimately rewarding experiences that I have personally been involved in. I also share some things that started happening before we knew about the cell tower. In hind-site I think the stars aligned for Bluefields and the outcome could have been very different for our neighborhood. Things seem to fall in to place for us and as a Bluefield resident I am proud and happy to share this story with you. Join Us For Historic Bluefields Annual Picnic and BBQ! Please be sure to join us on Saturday June 14th 2014 for our Historic Bluefields Annual picnic. Our gracious hosts Kara & Joe Siejakowski and their fellow neighbors are looking forward to you joining us in what is sure to be a grand occasion! We also have some special guests who will be joining and we have been supported by some very generous sponsors that have come together to ensure this will be an Bluefields event for the ages! As of today June 2nd 2014, we have 349 signatures! Our discussions with State Representative Darren Jernigan and Mr. Don Majors of Congressman Cooper's office Wednesday May 21st went well. We have their support and Congressman Cooper personally presented the information shared at the meeting to Parallel Industries and The Nashville/ Eastern Railway on Friday May 23rd and again on Friday May 30th. We hope to hear this week of the recommended next steps we should pursue. Historic Bluefields Demands Impact Study! A packed room at Fifty Forward on Tuesday night was given the first of what is expected to be several presentations and updates on the status of the 120 foot tall proposed cell tower that is slated to placed on railway land (and within inches of Bluefields private property). Join Us For Historic Bluefields Annual Picnic! We cordially invite Bluefields Residents and Neighbors to join Kara & Joe Siejakowski and their fellow neighbors for our Historic Bluefields Annual Picnic which will be held on Saturday June 14th, 2014 from 4:00 - 7:00 p.m. This year we ask all of Bluefields to help us rally around our neighbors at the Donelson Pike end of Bluefield Avenue that are in direct line of the new proposed cell tower. There has never been a better time for our neighborhood to stand together and united with each other. Please join us this Tuesday May 20, 2014 at 6:00 p.m. at Fifty Forward for our Historic Bluefields Neighborhood Meeting. We have lots to discuss with updates from Joe and Kara on the No Cell Tower at Historic Bluefields Campaign that kicked off last week.

You may leave these in the mailbox of 2724 Bluefield or pass them along to friends and family if you have already submitted the electronic version. No Cell Tower at Historic Bluefield's! A 120 foot Communications Cell Tower has been proposed to be placed on Railway Land next to (and on) private Bluefield Residential properties at the Donelson Pike and Bluefield Avenue end. This would have devastating effect on our Historic Neighborhood that has been a railway line neighbor for close to 100 years. Not only will property values be effected by the towers mamoth appearence (that most likely will be seen in winter from all over Bluefields), but critical sound and visual tree barriers will be removed and railway land pollutants that date over 100 years including fuel, old railway ties and equipment will be disturbed and released to contaminate immediate residential properties - properties that have a over 14 young children that play daily in their back yards. District 15 Councilman Phil Claiborne will be hosting an neighborhood information meeting in regard to the proposed communication tower to be located on the Bluefield's residents side of the tracks near the Lebanon Pike Entrance (opposite Fifty Forward). 'Keep Bluefields Beautiful' Spring Cleanup Day! 2014 Great American Cleanup comes to Bluefields! Keep America Beautiful's Great American Cleanup, the nation's largest community improvement program, takes place annually from March 1 through May 31, involving an estimated 3 million volunteers and attendees. To get into the spirit of this effort Historic Bluefields will be joining forces with "Clean Up Donelson Day" and we will be setting up 2 primary stations in Bluefields to clean up on Saturday March 22nd from 9:00 a.m. till 11:00 a.m.. Be A Good Neighbor and a Great Pet Owner! The Bluefields Homeowners Association Annual General Meeting was held on Monday, November 18th at Fifty Forward. A small but enthusiastic group was given a full year in review by President Tammy Hobbs and various board members. All houses wherein men have lived and died Are haunted houses. Through the open doors The harmless phantoms on their errands glide, With feet that make no sound upon the floors. 2013 Low Country Boil was Great Occasion! The 2013 Low Country Boil for Bluefields Neighborhood was a great occasion. With superb weather and a grand setting at the home of John and Mary Doak Bluefields neighbors were treated to great food and neighborhood friendship. The Bluefield Home Owners Association setup the event and thanks for all board members and in particular Ginny Russell who spent a lot of time and energy organizing the event as well as overseeing packing up. Also a Big Cheers to Jeff Pratt, homeowner on Overhill, who obtained the recipe from a former owner. Jeff also helped Ginny plan the food amounts when Ginny was grocery shopping for all the items. Thanks to John and Mary for being such gracious hosts! As we now head into October we are looking forward to Halloween at Bluefields so time for everyone to start thinking about those fall decorations! Be sure to mark your calendar and join the Bluefields Home Owners Association for their annual Low Country Boil on Saturday September 28th, 2013. Great Time at 2013 BHA Summer Picnic! Another successful Bluefield's neighborhood summer picnic is in the books! A fun time was had by everyone who came... the weather was great and it was nice to see old friends and meet new ones!

Although the 4 dimensions have been stable for over 600 years, something is not right about the time traps. Recently they have been moving, coalescing and even disappearing. The air around the time traps reeks of ozone; people are reporting strange and ominous sounds coming from within. Others have seen people entering a portal with a known destination and are never seen again. Space explorers have reported unnatural fluctuations in the time-space fabric, throwing them off course by many light years. Eminent scientists are researching the time traps, have come up with some unsettling theories. That the great cataclysm that caused them is reversing and the rifts are falling in on themselves. They cannot explain why this is happening, or if it is just a temporary reversal, but they are certain that if this process continues, unabated; all life is in grave peril. The power that would be unleashed would annihilate the dimensions, nothing would survive. Research is continuing, but the outcome is looking bleak. In Olde Yorke, dragons have been seen in more numbers than has ever have been in recorded history, all flying in the same direction as if chased by an unseen foe. What could possibly put fear in to so many dragons’ hearts? The newspapers in Dodge are full of strange tales, mysterious disappearances, and strange lights appearing in the skies above. Prospectors tell of gold singing, a strange, haunting, melancholy song. In Old Carthage more archeologists are missing than the seasonal norm, the authorities are requesting help from time travels to assist in tracking down the cause. Tides and floods are not predictable anymore, the Egyptians are worried, more and more rituals to Ra are being performed, trying to appease the gods. Has the war that ended in the year 2079, come back to deliver one final blow? Was the unnatural power unleashed, too much for the dimensions to contain? “I believe that the Time-space continuum is on the verge of collapse. All readings point to a reversal in the continuum, all energy, time, space and matter are being drawn together. My theory proves that the dimensions are imploding, the four striving to become one. This would put an incredible strain on the fabric of space-time, which I doubt it could withstand. What will happen at the point of implosion, I cannot predict. Will it be total annihilation? Will a new dimension be born? Or is this the cycle of nature, the 4 dimensions in their final throws of rebirth? Once the paper was made public, panic ensued. No one has the answers, people have no one to turn to. The gods themselves were saying nothing; perhaps even they feared what was coming. Cults began to grow, some worshipping the time rifts, others condemning them. Fighting broke out, civil unrest was high. People’s faces taught with worry, asking questions that nobody could answer. Some turned to religion, others crime and drugs, each trying to find their own way to meet the end. Others just disappeared without a trace. Clans have invested heavily in magical protection for their clan hall, pouring all the accumulated gold from over the last 600 years. Banks are collapsing as panic withdrawals continue, as the common people try to protect their own property, but all to no avail as the clans have pushed the price too high for anyone to be able to afford the services, even if they could. The magicians have exhausted their reserves of Mana, and cannot produce any more protection spells. There is a man, who instead of spending his wealth on protecting his own property and possessions, has invested his wealth in to creating a protected area, using his resources to create a bubble in space and time. This space is not large, it cannot hold more than food, water and the few that will be lucky enough to be inside the bubble when it is sealed. He has now fully prepared the bubble, exhausting himself, magically creating food and water that he knows will not perish. Hopefully enough for the unknown period of time it will take before it is safe to emerge from this sanctuary, indeed if ever. Who will this man allow to enter? What fee will he ask those that want to shelter inside the bubble? Who will still have the strength and the means to meet his terms? How many will join him, in this bid for survival? And most of all will this magic bubble truly save those, who are inside?

One of the biggest concerns for seniors as they get older is maintaining their independence; one of the biggest concerns for their loved ones is ensuring their safety and happiness. Senior home care can be a wonderful and effective way to provide aging adults with the assistance and support they need to age in place. However, if there comes a time when in-home care is not enough and a higher level of care is needed we can help with that as well. Always Best Care provides warm, compassionate and professional care for seniors and others when they need it most. Whether we are helping clients manage life’s daily routines, or providing respite care for the holidays, one thing you can always count on is that we are dedicated to exceeding your expectations. From our initial contact, we are committed to helping with nearly any care situation. We always provide free consultations to determine the right level of care that is needed. Assignments can range from a couple of hours to continuous live-in care. We can provide assistance and support for just about every non-medical, personal and social need your loved one may have. Some examples include Companionship Services, Home Health Services, and Personal Care Services. An assisted living community for seniors provides care for persons who need some help with activities of daily living, yet who wish to remain as independent as possible. These communities bridge the gap between independent living and nursing homes. Residents in assisted living communities aren’t able to live by themselves, but they don’t require constant care either. Residents may suffer from memory disorders, various diseases, or simply need help with mobility, incontinence or other challenges.

Our super popular side cut-out flats are back with some extra flair: a scalloped edge! Color: grey. Any chance I could size up or down in these? My TTS 8.5 is sold out. Or will they be restocked? Hi Michelle - You could try sizing down, but I recommend TTS. It looks like this shoe isn't available for me to reorder at the moment. But this type of style has been so popular, I am sure it will become available again sometime in the future, or something similar will come out. I have both 8 and 8.5 in BFF flats. 8 is a little snug and 8.5 is a big loose. What size should i get for this grey flats? Hi Nicole! The shoe sizing is tricky, isn't it! The grey flats will probably have a similar fit (size 8 a little snug, size 8.5 a little loose). With the closed toe, you might prefer them looser rather than tighter.

If you are considering cognitive skills training for you or someone you love, you most likely have questions. From how it works to our scientific research to our results, there is a lot to learn about our brain training center in Fort Collins. Though there can be several reasons for reading struggles, the root of the problem is often a weakness in auditory processing, which allows us to identify, segment, and blend sounds. But this isn’t the only weak skill that can impact reading. Other possibilities include poor attention, memory, and visual processing skills. At LearningRx - Fort Collins, we have helped past clients strengthen all of them. After you take the quiz, reach out to our Fort Collins brain training center to schedule your Brain Skills Assessment with one of our trainers. It takes about an hour to complete, is reasonably priced, and our trainer will get a vast understanding of your cognitive abilities. From here, we’ll be able to customize a plan that will fit your needs.

Harley Rouda has denounced Big Oil, but is reported to have invested as much as $500,000 in crude oil. Harley Rouda, a Democratic congressional candidate running in the primary for California’s 48th Congressional District, has campaigned vigorously against the oil industry. But, according to Rouda’s financial disclosure report, he has invested as much as $500,000 in crude oil. Rouda has been endorsed by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Sierra Club. It’s unclear if these investments will affect the endorsements.

Apple's long-awaited AirPower could be launching in the near future, based on coding changes that 9to5Mac's Guilherme Rambo says he found in the latest iOS 12.2 beta, released yesterday morning. There have been "significant changes" to the wireless charging code in the beta update, including "code responsible for identifying that two devices are charging on the same mat," which could indicate that Apple is planning an AirPower launch soon. Apple's AirPower charging mat will be able to charge an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods (with a new wireless charging case) all at once. The AirPower charging mat was first announced in 2017 alongside the iPhone X, but has seen production difficulties that led to multiple delays. In the iOS 12.2 beta specifically, there are changes to the 3D animations that are displayed on the largest of the charging devices to let you know charging levels. Apple has been silent on the AirPower ever since announcing it, but there have been continual signs that the Cupertino company is still working on it, including multiple recent rumors that a launch is happening in the spring. Apple on Monday introduced a new iPad Air and an iPad mini 5, and today introduced refreshed iMacs, suggesting it is perhaps aiming to roll out all of its spring hardware updates ahead of its services-focused event on March 25. Ahead of when the iPads and iMacs launched, we heard from a source that suggested Apple would debut new products on Monday through Wednesday, with a new iPod touch set to be announced tomorrow. We haven't heard word of an AirPower launch or an AirPods launch with new wireless charging case, but that doesn't mean it's not going to happen. There's a chance we will see AirPower and AirPods this week, but if not, it certainly seems like we're at least a bit closer to a debut. Is it one of the most delayed Apple products? Pretty much, although we have been waiting on a half-decent Mac Pro since December 2013. 18 months to launch a product they hyped at a keynote. I'm beginning to think there is nothing that cannot be predicted by looking at iOS code. It'll probably be bargain priced at $199.95. It would be a huge mistake to not launch the AirPower mat alongside the second generation AirPods. If I had a dime for every time this site said "suggests" when it came to possible new Apple gear, and it never panned out, I'd be able to buy this site. I don't see the value in such a product. As I’ve seen this comment so much, for some I guess there isn’t a value. However, for me, I travel multiple times per month. Just this last weekend I was away from Friday to Sunday. I had to unplug my iPhone wireless charger, my Apple Watch charger and my AirPods charger. I utilize them to the point where I need to charge them at least every other day. Then in the hotel I have to spread the chargers out for different outlets and I understand that it’s not the end of the world but having one charger now for all three products will just save that extra hassle every time I have to travel. So I hope Apple continues to see the value in this product, a product I’ve been anticipating since 2017. So it won't be able to charge AirPods, Apple Watch & iPhone at once? That's a shame. Apple's AirPower charging mat will be able to charge an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods (with a new wireless charging case) all at once. You don’t? I guess you don’t have an iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPod. I do and my girlfriend does as well. 6 cables and chargers. That’s excluding our iPads and MacBook pros, plus the extra charging cables in the living room when we need to charge in there. So even if you can’t see the value, there are people like me who are on edge waiting for the release of AirPower. It has tremendous value in its ease of use and convenience. I’d pay up to $150 for one of these and I want 3, 2 for the bed room and one for the living room. Not to mention how easy packing chargers when traveling will become. The only thing that seems special about your use case is the tortured description of what you go through for travel. Pretty sure every traveler has a pouch/compartment/bag for chargers. AP won't change that. It may reduce the number of power bricks you carry, but it would increase the surface area of the charger you'd carry. AP is not a small device. I'd bet it's no smaller than the smart surge protector I carry in the bottom of my travel backpack. I understand you're trying to make a point. But it's always funny when people try to make a point by turning pedestrian activities into Sisyphean tasks. You like AP. That's totally fine. You don't have to make charging a "maddening" prospect to justify liking it. If charging really is maddening, you should really look into a smart surge with usb. Get's rid of most power bricks... or just wait on AP to see if it solves your issues. Lmao your comment. It’s simple, we want a single charger that can charge all our devices, set down and forget it. When I get home from work, I set my watch down, my phone and my AirPods in the same place on a single surface, done, finished. No need to physically plug in my phone and AirPod, and set the watch on a separate surface. It’s simple and convenient, we like simplicity and convenience, and what you propose is quite the opposite. There is a want and demand for AirPower. The creators of many of our technological devices use the same devices we use so that puts them in a unique position to understand our wants, needs and frustrations. They’re able to do something about it because they have the required skill set. AirPower will sit nicely on my dresser for my iPhone, AirPod and Apple Watch, it will do the same on the night stand for my girlfriend, it will also be welcomed in my living room on the side table when we need to charge our cellphones or guests cellphones.

Glubokoye is first mentioned in about 1414 A.D. as a land owned by Zenovy Bratoshich. Grand Duke Vitovt granted the right for Zenovy Bratoshich to own his father’s lands, with the estate Glubokoye mentioned as one of them. The next recorded mentioning of Glubokoye is dated by 1514. The Lithuanian Metrica reads that “an elder of Lord Yuri Disnensky… murdered a man of Lord, His Grace Verkhnyanets… while returning from the market in the estate of Lord Yuri of Glubokoye…”. Hence one can make a conclusion that the town of Glubokoye was a major trade center as early as the start of the 16th century. At that time the town of Glubokoye was divided into two parts. The southwestern one was owned by the Zenovichs and was part of Oshmyany District, Vilnius Voivodship. The northeastern one was owned by the Korsaks and was part of Polotsk Voivodship. A market square with shops, warehouses, a Uniate church, a hospital was the center of the southwestern part. The Glubokoye Castle was built there. The town’s northeastern part also had a market square as its center where roads to Disna, Polotsk and the town of Berezvechye began. During the Lithuanian war of 1558-1583 Glubokoye and the surrounding area were considerably destroyed by Moscow troops. In the late 16th century a Calvinist temple, a library and a school were built in Glubokoye. The Trinity Catholic church was opened in 1628. In 1636 voivod of Mstislavl and mayor of Disna Iosif Korsak founded a catholic church and a monastery of the Barefoot Carmelites Order. The Saint Trinity Church was built in mid-17th century (it burnt down in the 1880s). During the war between the Moscow kingdom and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1654-1667) Glubokoye was occupied by Moscow troops. They built a small wooden fortress to station a military unit. On 6 November 1661 a major battle took place near Glubokoye: troops of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania led by Charnetsky destroyed a Russian army led by Khovansky (over 18,000 people). In 1668 the southwestern part of Glubokoye was acquired by the Radziwills. According to the 1702 inventory, the Radziwills estate in Glubokoye had a one-story wooden building, a subsidiary building, a bakery, warehouses, stables, sheds, a pond, a water-powered mill, and other household buildings. The estate included 263 households. In the 18th century the town had two market squares with shops, with one-story wooden homes prevailing. A synagogue was built in 1742. The Ilyinskaya Chapel was built at the cemetery in the late 18th century. After the second division of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1793) Glubokoye became part of the Russian Empire. During the 1812 war Glubokoye was occupied by French troops between July and December. Napoleon stayed there for six days starting 18 July. A redeployment depot and major food warehouses were set up there. Rebels fought against government troops during the resurrection of 1830-1831. Since 1842 the southeastern part of the town was owned by the state while the southwestern one was privately owned. Glubokoye was the capital of Glubokoye District, included 212 households with 2,161 residents (1861). In 1886 Glubokoye had a brewery, a distillery, a brick factory, several warehouses and private shops. Sunday was the market day. Two fairs were held every year. According to the 1897 population census the town had 5,564 residents. A railway was built to Glubokoye during World War One. The first Soviets were set up in the town in November 1917. In February-December 1918 Glubokoye was occupied by German troops. In August 1919 – July 1920 and in October 1920 the town was occupied by Polish troops. 5 July 1920 saw battles between Soviet and Polish armies, with many casualties. In 1921-1939 Glubokoye was part of the Poland, the capital of Disna District, Vilnius Voivodship where 9,700 residents lived before 1939. In autum 1939 Glubokoye lands became part of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic. Glubokoye District (with the town of Glubokoye as its capital) was created by the relevant decree of the Presidium of the BSSR Supreme Council on 15 January 1940 as an administrative unit of Vileika Oblast. The district included the town of Glubokoye, part of Glubokoye County and part of Zalesse County of Disna Oblast. The district occupied 592 km2 and had 35,099 residents (including 9,650 residents in the town of Glubokoye). On 2 July 1941 Glubokoye was occupied by the Nazi and converted into the center of a region of the Reichskommissariat Ostland (Realm Commissariat Eastland). Located in the town were the region’s administration, a German garrison, and army warehouses. A Jewish ghetto was created in the town and annihilated in 1943. A death camp (stalag No. 351) was situated in the Berezvechye area. The victims were over 27,000 Soviet and Italian POWs. Soviet troops liberated the town of Glubokoye on 3 July 1944. Due to the new administrative division (as from 20 September 1944) Glubokoye District became part of Polotsk Oblast. An administrative reform was carried out in January 1954. Glubokoye District and Plissa District became part of Molodechno Oblast. The district became part of Vitebsk Oblast on 20 January 1960. In December 1962 Glubokoye District’s area grew larger with the area of Plissa District that had been abolished.

The Lego video games by British developer Traveller's Tales are, consistently, a near-cosmic impossibility. Most if not all of them have managed to be appealing to both kids and adults simultaneously, charming and/or funny, packed with good gameplay, and based off of a big and established IP to boot. Usually, games with that kind of recipe are mediocre at best and terrible at worst, owing to a deficiency in time, development talent, or both. But here comes TT Games once again, out to continue their hot streak with Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2. It starts with an absurdly large roster. While I only got to see the Guardians of the Galaxy, the roster screen had so many locked characters on it that it was almost intimidating. The roster screen had so many locked characters on it that it was almost intimidating. I began with Star-Lord, Groot (full-size, but he has the ability to temporarily transform into Baby Groot), Rocket, Gamora, and Drax aboard Star-Lord's ship, with three of them on the screen and swappable at a time. Once you knock a few things around and rebuild a couple of others, you'll be transported to the planet's surface to face off against a Celestial – a gigantic robot enemy so large that he takes up the whole screen despite being waist-deep in a city bay as you battle him from land. In addition to his primary blaster attack, Starlord tosses gravity mines that pull nearby objects (or enemies) toward them, crushing them with imploding force (albeit cutely; after all, this is a Lego game...). Rocket, meanwhile, can team up with Groot, hopping onto those big wooded shoulders to cause even more damage to plastic-block foes. Baby Groot in action in Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2. With TT Games leaving last-gen behind, LMSH 2 looks fantastic. As for the premise this go around? With so many superheroes, how can you connect them all? "This game is all about time," the game's creative director says, be it time manipulation or characters from other times. "We have a lot of time manipulation in the game, something that can be used for and against you." As such, Chronopolis will be your hub world for the game. "It's a city in limbo, out of time," TT notes. That theme of "time" came into play during the Celestial boss fight. You need to use all of your characters and all of their mechanics in order to take it down. At one juncture, a destroyed attack ship gets chronologically rewound (read: it gets un-destroyed), allowing you to hop in it and weaken the beast before shooting its exposed wrist, taking Drax up to its shoulder to trigger that weak spot, before Starlord starts hurling gravity mines into the newly exposed core in its belly to finish the encounter. Above: IGN's review of the first Lego Marvel Super Heroes game from 2013. Marvel Super Heroes 2 features a non-linear story, and there will be crossovers in keeping with the time-manipulating theme. And though the action during the Celestial fight couldn't have been more hectic, the Lego charm shines through if you decide, for instance, to put on Star-Lord's mix tape in the middle of battle and witness all the characters stop what they're doing and start dancing. TT also notes that Marvel Super Heroes 2 features a non-linear story, and that there will be crossovers in keeping with the time-manipulating theme – Captain America and Captain from Texas were cited as an example. And with TT leaving last-gen behind (while also adding a Switch version), LMSH 2 looks fantastic, especially in cutscenes. Here's hoping the Lego games can continue to rewrite our expectations for licensed tie-ins.

On today’s Bible Answer Man broadcast, Hank stresses the importance of Os Guinness’ new book, Last Call for Liberty. If you care about American liberties and the future of our nation, Last Call for Liberty is an absolute must-read. Few issues are more fundamental than our most basic liberties… and those liberties are under attack like never before. Political debate has degenerated into degrading and barbaric incivility. American leaders and opinion leaders are at each other’s throats intent on tearing each other apart. Many Americans are seething with rage over other Americans and so America is locked in a mortal struggle for what each side believes is the soul of the republic. As Os Guinness puts it, what we are seeing is not politics as usual, but politics in a dangerous radical style led by leaders who should know better. Isn’t suicide a lack of trust in God?
I'm so happy to offer this class: my Relic Ring! This is a class that I've taught many times in person. My students love it, not just because it's beautiful but it's also lots of fun to make. My inspiration for this piece came from a visit to the Museum of Fine Arts, in Houston. There was an exhibit of jewelry from the ancient city of Pompeii. It impressed me so much that these amazing relics had been unearthed from beneath layers of ash and destruction, and still survived. Using the inspiration from the Pompeii pieces, I set to work. I wanted my "relic" to have the look of something that might have been excavated from an archaeological dig. I had a great time accomplishing that...and now you will, too. One of the best things about this project is that you won't need a lot of fancy tools. It can actually be done using simple hand tools but I'm going to show you a few different ways to accomplish things like polishing...including a great shortcut using your tumbler, if you have one. If you have a JoolTool, I'll show you a great, quick way to finish your ring. If not, I have an alternative that's super easy! I'll show you which stones work best for this project and how to find gorgeous stones without spending a ton of money. There's a minimal amount of soldering in this one, which makes it a great class for beginners. But, more advanced students will enjoy it, too! We'll be using a butane torch because it's an accessible and inexpensive way to learn metalsmithing. But, there are some tricks to it and I'll help you learn how to get the most from your butane torch. We'll also be doing some really fun texturing. I'll show you a few different ways to do this, including how to make your piece look like an ancient relic! As a pioneer in the field of online jewelry making classes, I strive to make sure my workshops are of the highest quality and my online classes are an exceptional value. They include highly detailed, excellent quality videos that you'll be able to watch as many times as you like; no driving, no airfare, no hotels and no schlepping your heavy stuff! You’ll have continual access to my classroom for the duration of the class. Like to work in your jammies?...the videos will be at hand…a click away…any time of day or night, for you to view as many times as you want. I love making jewelry and sharing my skills. I give you quality online course content enabling you to learn from the privacy of your own home. You'll feel like you're right there in my studio, with me! Your payment is your registration. You should receive your log on information, via email, within 3 days (please see below). A complete tool list will be made available, along with a resources list and other pdf files. I'll be available to teach, guide, critique and answer your questions for the duration of class. I've wanted to offer this class for a long time and have had many requests for it. I'm so excited to offer it now! Please Read: Important... I accept Paypal payments only. Please make sure that your Paypal email address is the one you would like the classroom password sent to. Also, please make sure your full name is included in your paypal payment information. When you register, if you do not hear from me, please check your spam/junk folder. If you don't see my email with the log on information, contact me via email: mocknet@sbcglobal.net, my website, or facebook. If you have not received the log on information within 3 days, and it's not in your spam email folder, please contact me. Registration will remain open through the early March, 2019. The workshop will run for two full months on my private classroom site. All videos will be posted on the first day of class. Videos are not downloadable but, once the videos are posted, students will be able to view them any time, and as many times as desired. This means you can work in your jammies, at three in the morning, if you choose! I will be available the entire duration of the class for questions and troubleshooting. For a metalsmithing class, this one uses comparatively few tools. Please understand that it is difficult for me to determine the cost of the tools you'll need but you will need some basic metalsmith tools: files, pliers, hammers, bench block, butane torch, etc...some of which you may already have. Other tools like a flex-shaft and tumbler are optional for this class. PDF's of the complete tools/supplies/resources lists will be provided after registration.
Day 12 is here!! We are half way through the competition already! Hopefully, you have a full set of answers so far, and can maybe have a guess at what the overall answer could be?? Let’s see if today’s question helps a little. Kajagoogoo debut album White Feathers contains a track called ‘Frayo‘ – a firm fan favourite and album highlight. Limahl has been asked on many occasions what the lyrics are about and so KajaFax thought we, in turn, would ask the fans that very same question. Which European country is the subject of Kajagoogoo song ‘Frayo’? As you all know, Limahl’s brand new single London For Christmas is now available. To finish today’s post, here is the audio from Limahl’s recent interview with Pat Marsh of BBC Radio Kent. ← Limahl BBC Radio 2 Interview Today!
Here’s a headline worthy of P.T. Barnum himself: Jenny Lind, the most famous singer in all of Europe, spurns marriage proposals from dukes, doctors, artists and bankers, secretly moves to Paris to be with her one true love – Fryderyk Chopin, to nurse him back to health, and elope to America. Upon meeting Swedish soprano Jenny Lind, Felix Mendelssohn called her “as great an artist as ever lived; the greatest he had known." So moved that he composed this aria from his oratorio Elijah with Lind’s voice in mind… AND was later fingered by Lind’s eventual husband for pursuing a more-than-professional relationship with her. Mendelssohn had plenty of company on that front. Writer Hans Christian Andersen too, was a failed suitor, but his story, “The Nightingale,” stuck; Lind was ever after known as “The Swedish Nightingale.” One contemporary called her career “quite Napoleonic in its splendid and unbroken success; her conquest of Europe was no less rapid and complete than that of the great world-shaker himself.” Jenny Lind then conquered America; after demanding – and getting – the extraordinary sum of $150,000 in advance from P.T. Barnum, who got all of his money back – and then some. Giving rise to a new nickname: “Barnum’s Bird.” "A visit from such a woman who regards her artistic powers as a gift from Heaven and who helps the afflicted and distressed will be a blessing to America,” bragged Barnum. But before America came Chopin. In 1847, Jenny Lind took London by storm via her captivating performances in the opera - “Robert le Diable” by Giacomo Meyerbeer. Chopin, too, was in London, and they quickly became friends. Chopin wrote admiringly about her in his letters, but Lind kept their relationship silent. Today, how much they interacted is now the subject of intense speculation. Was Chopin indeed the great love of Jenny Lind’s life? Did they have a secret rendezvous in Paris? The debate rages.
If my private landlord asks me to leave, what are my rights? All tenants have a right to due process. As such, the law requires that certain criteria be met in order for a landlord to legally evict a tenant from their property. These criteria vary depending on the type of tenancy a resident holds, and failure to comply with any may be grounds to resist an eviction. What amounts to harassment by a landlord? Harassment by a landlord may take various forms – it may involve a landlord interfering with a tenant/occupiers use of the property or engaging in intimidating or violent behaviour. Harassment may often lead to, or occur along with illegal eviction. A tenant’s right against a landlord engaging in harassing behaviour will depend partly on the nature of the tenancy or licence held at the property. The following gives an overview of common forms of harassment. Can I stop an eviction going ahead? If your landlord wishes to evict you from your home, they must first serve you with a notice that usually sets out the reason for doing so. On expiry of that notice, they must then apply to Court for a Possession Order. Usually the Possession Order takes effect within 14-28 days, meaning that if you have not left the property by the date ordered, your landlord can apply for a bailiff warrant to evict you.
When Dre & I were newlyweds we walked into Sleep Number in search of a bed (that store is amazing). We walked in there and a sweet lady showed us around. She took us to every bed and explained how each one worked and answered any questions we had. After spending a good amount of time with us she left us alone to venture around and test things out on our own. She gave us her card and said, “It was great to meet you both. If you have any questions or need anything else give me a call”. Although we were in love with Sleep Number, we wanted to look at all our options. We went down the road to Mattress King. There were three gentlemen there, all eager to make a sale. They showed us the beds they thought would be a good fit and pretended to leave us but instead watched our every move. The head guy would continuously point out something about each bed we went to. He even mentioned how he was having a “sale” (keep in mind these guys didn’t leave us alone). They asked what our budget was and offered to knock down the price if we would by a bed right then and there. We repeatedly said, “We are just looking and that we have to talk about big financial decisions before purchasing today”. The guy got snippy with us and basically implied that he couldn’t understand why we would come if we weren’t going to buy a bed. My jaw hit the floor and we basically left. Sleep Number was beyond personable and super kind. They took the opportunity to get to know us and then they explained their product. Not only did they explain their product but they were CONFIDENT in what they were selling. They DID NOT pressure us or continuously hassle us to buy from them. They knew their product was great and that we would try out the competitors and realize they were the best. Lastly, they weren’t upset if we didn’t buy from them. Mattress King continuously pressured us from the beginning to buy a bed. They did not give us space, and they were extremely rude at the end. Shoot . . .they were rude the whole time! They didn’t care about us they just wanted to make a sale. Our goal is to eventually purchase the Sleep Number bed. The experience has sold us. Yes the product is AMAZING but it was that lady in the store who encouraged us to look around. She gave us space. She did all she could with us and then just LET US BE. I feel as photographers we have to remember that not every client is going to be right for us. Once you have had your first initial meeting and gave it 100% with a genuine heart, then that is all you can do. Follow up a week later and let it be. The continuous hassling is going to kill your business. Encourage people to find the right fit, after all it IS the biggest day of their life. If they found someone else thats great! It wasn’t meant to be and that date is just waiting for your ideal client. Continue to be confident in your business and the right person will come a long who wants you for you.

Last edited by burque505 on 23 Mar 2018, 16:52, edited 1 time in total. I am using Windows 7, and Office 2010 on a 64 bit computer. And my company handles people healthcare information, so the security is PARANOID. PS, I just tripple check that Excel_Get and Word_Get work on my computer. I pasted the code for all three into a new script, and ran the example Caption script for all three programs, with brand new empty documents open up for each. I got the Captions for Word and Excel, and the same error message for PowerPoint. For those using Office 2010, this will choke (thanks clina1j). PowerPoint 2010 uses a "paneClassDC" control, and 2013 - 2016 use "mdiClass". For those who have 2010, try the code by awel20 in this thread. I've only tested it on XP in a VM, but it works fine. You can incorporate code like this to handle window and control class variants. WinGet, hWnd, ID, % "ahk_class PP..?FrameClass" That code definitely works, jeeswg, thanks.

Carolina House provides leading eating disorder treatment to ensure long-lasting recovery for a healthier and more satisfying life. Anorexia nervosa: Those who struggle with anorexia nervosa will view themselves as being overweight even though they are not. As a result, they participate in extremely intense dieting behaviors, including limiting their caloric intake, which leads to malnutrition. Individuals who are afflicted with anorexia tend to become fixated on their weight to the point that they will follow a dangerously restrictive diet and weigh themselves continuously throughout the day. Bulimia nervosa: Individuals with bulimia nervosa participate in both binging and purging. Binging involves ingesting extremely large amounts of food, often at a very quick pace. Purging can include inducing vomiting or abusing enemas, laxatives, or diuretics to rid their bodies of the food they just consumed. Those with bulimia are typically at or slightly above normal weight, and are often afflicted with extreme anxiety regarding weight gain. Binge-eating disorder: People who have binge-eating disorder tend to struggle with controlling their eating behaviors. In response to their lack of control, they will consume large amounts of food, often very quickly. When in the midst of an eating binge, people who have this disorder may feel as though they are incapable of stopping or controlling their eating. The periods of binge-eating are often followed by feelings of shame, guilt, and self-loathing, which can prompt future binging episodes. The National Eating Disorders Association reports that a little more than 6% of individuals battle with an eating disorder at some point in their lives. Sadly, those with eating disorders are at a greater risk for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Those who develop eating disorders tend to begin displaying symptoms at a median age of 12 to 13 years of age. Genetic: Those with close family members, like parents or siblings, who struggle with eating disorders tend to also battle similar issues at some point in their lives. Environmental: One’s environment can play a significant role in the development of an eating disorder. For example, those who have grown up in homes with family members who were exceptionally critical about their own or other’s physical appearance and weight are more likely to battle with an eating disorder. Peer pressure and teasing at school can also influence an individual’s chances of developing an eating disorder.

With this week’s meal plan we will try to re-balance our system’s overindulgences and take into account our shortage of time during the school holiday period. Trying to keeping the dinners lighter and as easy as possible. Did you overindulgence in Chocolate over Easter? How are the school holidays going? Just one more week to go then you can get back to our usual routine! Monday: For Meat Free Monday try Black Pepper Stir Fried Noodles from Pinch of Yum. These are delicious, serve with extra Chinese greens on the side. We did not use Udon noodles but replaced with the Japanese Ramen noodles instead. I bought hard tofu but it was still quite soft, it may be best to head to a specialist store like CitySuper. Tuesday: Kale & Quinoa Minestrone Soup – Because sometimes one meat free meal just isn’t enough! Wednesday: Meat Balls in Tomato Sauce Not exactly the quickest meal to prepare but if you’ve got a spare hour it really is well worth the effort. It’s not complicated or tricky and you could get the kids helping roll the balls! Also you can keep this meal lighter by not eating it with pasta, have you tried spiralized courgette as a pasta replacement? Thursday: Something quick and easy today with minimal prep, along the lines of a simple Tray Baked Chicken. If you had the tray baked chicken recently then replace with pork instead. Same principle, just use: 600-800g of Pork collar cut into cubes, place in a baking tray, season with salt & pepper, add plenty of garlic cloves, a few sprigs of thyme. Cook at 200C for 30-35 minutes or until nice and golden brown, verging on crispy. Serve straight from the baking tray, with a side salad and crusty bread to mop up the juices. Friday: Pizza – Make the dough the night before and let rise overnight in the fridge for a slow fermentation which will result in a super tasty dough. Top with no more than 3 or 4 toppings and serve with a salad. Alternatively, For those fiercely wanting to keep things on a lighter tone this week – have you tried Cauliflower Crust Pizza yet? I just experimented with it this week – it was surprisingly tasty, the only problem is the base did not crisp up. Here’s the link to the recipe I used. Let me know if you make it, would love to know your results and any tips on getting that base more crispy! Baking: Still got lots of Easter chocolate hanging around? Get the kids in the kitchen helping out with this dead simple no-bake Chocolate Crispy Fridge Cake. Oh no, you ate all your chocolate? Get down to the supermarket, there’s probably a surplus Easter chocolate on sale! Did you make anything from last week’s weekly meal plan? If you did, let me know how you got on. All feedback and suggestions welcome. Don’t be shy to share your ideas and thoughts in the comments box below. I’d love to hear from you.

Cat Walk Boogie and Blues is Debra's debut album featuring her piano boogie-woogie piece, "Cat Walk Boogie". Debra plays with her heart and soul. Listen to Debra’s debut CD, Cat Walk Boogie & Blues... a diverse collection of boogie woogie and blues! The CD features her original composition "Cat Walk Boogie" with Debra on piano and Jim Murray, drums and Jay Olaszek, bass. When Debra Hope Miller, a.k.a. Little Debra, became interested in the blues and boogie woogie, she became immersed in the two styles. She has been influenced by many great blues pianists including Ray Charles, Otis Spann, Erroll Garner and Erwin Helfer. Her musical education began with formal training in classical piano and music theory in college. She then took many years off from playing the piano in order to build a business. She loves many styles of music, and has written music in other genres too, including classical. Debra plays a lot by ear and with her soul. She is an arranger, pianist, author, composer and singer-songwriter. The title of this debut CD comes from Debra's composition, "Cat Walk Boogie", which is a nod to the playful and inquisitive attitude that our feline friends bring to everyday life - the same kind of attitude Debra brings to the piano. On Cat Walk Boogie, Debra brings her musical styling to a world that's still in love with the greats. On behalf of Debra, she hopes you enjoy this tribute to piano blues and boogie-woogie...and invite you to feel the music in your heart! I love your choice of material for the CD, in particular the tango/swing tune and the general nod to our ragtime past, sly little Monk riffs and other tasty touches. You don't hear much straight boogie-woogie these days and it's refreshing. Little Debra covers a range of ballads, blues and boogie territory on her Cat Walk Boogie and Blues CD. There were several favorites of mine, with After Hours being the top. Little Debra brings life to old classic standards like \"Georgia\" and \"Do You Know What it Means to Miss New Orleans\". In \"Georgia\" one can hear a sensitive rendition recalling Hoagie and Ray. Her original piece, \"Cat Walk Boogie\", is short and sweet like a feline frolicking on the keyboards. \"Otis in the Dark\" a tribute to Otis Spann, I compared to Otis\'s 1961 original and he would have been proud. In \"Ain\'t Nobody\'s Business\", there is a tasteful laid back piano sound. And \"How Long Blues\", another blues classic, Little Debra covers both ends of the keyboard with the steady slow tempo and the melody accented with frills.

In February, Kinski collaborates for the third time with our good friends, NYC dancers robbinschilds, A.L. Steiner & AJ Blanford for C.L.U.E., this time in MOMA San Francisco. This one was a doozy. We were able to use the entire atrium at MOMA, and it was this massive, boomy colorful sonic explosion. With dancing! In April, Kinski was featured on a compilation from Translinguistic Other ‎for a non-album track, “Whatever Happened to Madeleine Stowe.” It’s a double vinyl release called Portable Shrines Magic Sound Theatre Vol. I. In December, Kinski played with Cave from Chicago at the Comet. No pics, but that ruled. That’s all we need to say.

Settling the bill can be awkward, especially when you’re out on a first date, with friends or even distant family. Apps like Foodivide and Splitwise can help do the math on splitting the check if you want to pay the precise amount of what you owe at the table. But forget never having cash — half of respondents to a 2017 US Bank survey of more than 2,000 participants said they carry cash less than half the time while they’re out. Who is actually supposed to pay after you’ve swiped right or are out to dinner with family? Still, figuring out the politics of who pays can be tricky in the moment. Here’s how to navigate the dreaded bill in any scenario. When you’re going out with family, whoever does the inviting typically foots the bill. So if Dad, Mom, an aunt, uncle or cousin does the asking, expect them to pay — but it’s always worth offering to kick in a few bucks, especially if you can afford to, etiquette experts note. If you’re out with siblings, don’t expect the person who makes the most to foot the bill every time. It’s okay to let a sis or bro pick up the check now and then, Thomas said, but be prepared to reciprocate the gesture, or simply split the tab each time to avoid an argument. Always expect to go Dutch when grabbing drinks or dinner with friends, Thomas said. It’s always easiest to split the bill among everyone who joins instead of splitting hairs over the cost of separate menu items, especially if it’s a big group, Thomas added. Another way to avoid the hassle is to have one person foot the bill and use Venmo to pay back the friend exactly what you owe — that way if you get something small, you don’t get stuck paying more than you should. “Let’s say I grab the check, knowing full well you’ll Venmo me the funds — that’s absolutely fine,” Thomas said. Whoever does the asking should presumably be the one to pay the bill on a first date, Thomas insists. But if you feel strongly about going Dutch, that’s perfectly fine too. If your boss is asking you to a lunch meeting to talk about work, expect that he or she is going to pick up the tab. “If work is actually being done, the implication is that the boss will pay. In most cases, there is an expense account. If you’re unsure, you can always offer when the bill comes,” Thomas said. On the reverse end, if you’re asking to meet with your boss outside of work hours to get career advice, then you should be the one to treat, Thomas said. If your boss insists on paying the bill, however, it’s fine to stand down. The offer shows that you appreciate his or her time.

To Sleep With Anger 1990 DVD (Region 1 - Playable in North America - The US, Canada, Mexico, etc.) Full Frame. Color. Starring: Danny Glover, Paul Butler, DeVaughn Nixon, Mary Alice. African-American, independent film director, Charles Burnett's low-key drama centres on the dynamics of a black middle-class family living in South Central Los Angeles. When Harry (Danny Glover) turns up on the doorstep of his old friend Gideon (Paul Butler) looking for a roof over his head, Gideon cannot refuse. Gideon's wife, however, does not want another person in the family house as their grown son and his wife are still living with them. To ingratiate himself into the family group, Harry reminds them of their Southern roots; but his drinking does him no favors. When Gideon has a stroke, Harry takes over the running of the household and they begin to see the real man behind the charm. "When Harry comes to town, he brings good times, bad times... And a lot of trouble!"

After making comments that were regarded as “offensive toward the transgender community,” streamer HelenaLive has been permanently banned from Twitch. According to her, it has to do with comments she made about gender. In a follow-up email, Twitch claimed that HelenaLive had “been banned several times earlier” while also making note of the fact that her “last chance is already gone.” Helena says this is inaccurate, as she has only ever been banned once prior to this incident. However, the HelenaLive channel on Twitch has since been terminated altogether, which means past streams of games like League of Legends and more are no longer accessible. Helena claims that these would have proved her innocence in the matter and shown that she did not say anything to offend the transgender community. We've reached out to Twitch for comment, and will update should the company respond. What are your thoughts on this situation? Do you believe that Helena should have been banned from Twitch? Sound off in the comment section below, or hit me up over on Twitter @anarkE7!

Last week I had the chance to see Fall On Your Sword perform at the Lincoln Center and I LOVED it. Drawing from their work as composers for film, TV, and advertising, their live show is a blend of original music and visual elements. Behind the trio, a plasma screen played bits from movie classics on loop incorporating one liners into the music, creating a humorous mix. Sonically comparisons to LCD Soundsystem come to mind which makes sense considering Philip Mossman is a founding member of LCD. I admire Fall On Your Swords work in composing and getting to see this performance made me a bigger fan and I’m looking forward to hearing more them.
When I was in Oahu, other than stuffing my face with malassadas (malasadas), sampling local Hawaiian cuisine, and feasting on shrimp, I ate Japanese food almost every day. Oahu is a real gem for Japanese food, thanks to the many Japanese tourists and also locals who are obsessed with Japanese cuisine. There are countless authentic Japanese restaurants dotting Waikiki Beach: ramen joint, sushi bar, izakaya, and yakiniku (Japanese BBQ). I was in Japanese food heaven during the vacation; the abundant seafood and fresh produce accentuate the already great taste to tempting perfection. Yakisoba or Japanese fried noodles/焼きそば is one of the dishes I particularly enjoyed during my stay there. Yakisoba is pretty much the Japanese version of Chinese chow mein, but there is a certain appeal about yakisoba—the ramen noodles andthe sharp-flavored benishoga (picked ginger strips) make yakisoba a bright-tasting noodle dish. I loved it. Yakisoba or Japanese fried noodles is a popular dish. Inspired by Chinese fried noodles, this yakisoba recipe is made with cabbage, carrot, and pork. Heat up wok with oil. Add garlic and stir fry until light brown in color. Add pork and do a few quick stirs before adding cabbage and carrot. Stir a few times and add noodles and all the seasonings. Continue to stir-fry until the vegetables and noodles are cooked, for 1-2 minutes. Transfer out and serve immediately with some benishoga (Japanese picked ginger). You can find fresh yakisoba noodles at Japanese stores or Asian stores. Usually, they come with yakisoba seasoning sauce. You can use the sauce or make yakisoba from scratch using my yakisoba recipe above. All photos and recipes on Rasa Malaysia are copyright protected. Please do not use the photos and recipes without prior written permission. If you wish to republish this recipe, please rewrite the recipe in your own words instead of copy and paste and link back to //rasamalaysia.com/yakisoba-recipe/. Thank you very much! Bee, this looks delicious! Thanks for participating in Blog Away Hunger:-) All it takes is a 25 cents to provide a meal, so every little bit counts! Yum, love yakisoba. This recipe sound simple enough yet delicious. Oh, my dry-run for your chix satay and peanut sauce went well so it’s a go for Sunday! Awesome, let me know how you like the satay and the sauce! Yum, we love Japanese, not had yakisoba for ages, will have to try your recipe. Will have to compromise on the noodles though as we can’t get them in Spain. Debs – good luck making yakisoba in Spain. Please share your yakisoba when you make it. Yum! This is taking me down food-memory lane back to my trip to Japan several years ago. We do have a Japanese grocery here but I’ve never noticed any fresh noodles; I’ll have to inquire next time I’m there. For the 2 oz. pork, would you just buy something like a single boneless pork chop at the butcher counter? Correct. My first meal ever in Tokyo was a plate of yakisoba. So good! Oh no! I was looking through all of your recipes for a noodle dinner inspiration last night (I had a craving) and didn’t see this post until this morning. It’s not a problem though because I often have noodle cravings- about twice a week. :) Thanks for this recipe. It’s going to satisfy me next week I’m sure. Yes, I have cravings for noodles all the time too, and this yakisoba is great. Yes, yakisoba already reminded me of my travel to Japan! Delicious. You mentioned the pickled ginger– benishoga. Is this served on the side or incorporated in the yakisoba as an ingredient? They are served on top of the yakisoba, but I served it on the side. It’s up to you. yum..very simple and reminds me of the time when i went to cairns and it was littered with awesome jap food! Cairns with Japanese food, that’s interesting. Haven’t been to that part of Australia. i just adore yakisoba! they’re my favourite noodle dish ever! and your recipe looks so delicious! i love your blog and photos, lovely! Thanks for the comment, yes, I love yakisoba too. This recipe looks great! I love yakisoba..I also love okonomiyaki! Yes, food in Japan is great. I love it, too. This looks delicious, and I’m all for inexpensive dishes! Yes, yakisoba is cheap and good. WOW!! This dish sounds incredible! My hubby and I eat Asian inspired food at least 2x a week in our home. Our commissary just started carrying refrigerated yakisoba noodles, so I am so excited to make this for dinner tonight! Bookmarking and “liked” you on Facebook! I will be back for more yummy recipes! :) Thanks! Hi there. I would love to try this recipe, but don’t drink and therefore have no sake. Is there something I could use in its place without completely comprising the recipe? Thanks. You can use Chinese rice wine. I have recently discovered a little mom and pop Japanese restaurant close to my work and have been addicted to their Yakisoba noodles. I’ve been searching for a good recipe that I could make quickly and with a large volume (I have 2 small kids that require lots of attention). Google pointed me towards this recipe and I tried it last night. It was absolutely amazing! Everyone in my house loved it so much that their were no leftovers for me to take to work today (bummer!). Thanks for this great recipe and I am looking forward to trying more from your site! About how many servings is this for? My husband is gluten free. Can rice noodles be used for this or are they too soft? Any other suggestions for gluten free noodles? Thanks! The real secret to authentic yakisoba like you’ll find it in Japan: “yakisoba sauce”. It’s a chuunou sauce like tonkatsu sauce or okonomiyaki sauce. It has some fruit and vegetable purees, a variety of spices, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, and worcestershire sauce. It’s a bit spicy, sour, sweet, salty, and pungent. Along with the benishoga this provides a very tangy and pungent, very bright noodle dish highly unlike all other asian stir-fried noodle dishes. Mirin is a Japanese sweet wine. Japanese sake is the rice wine. If you can’t find mirin, just use sugar to add sweetness, for sake, you can use Chinese rice wine. Thank you Bee for the nice recipe. Have a Great Week! I know these meals are quick and easy,but are they good for you at all?

Also, with real estate, you can earn some of the substantial profit over the sale of your property. You may have seen a luxury property, and you do not know the exact price. Or they may have asked the price, and you do not know whether the price is worth. It is then advisable that you consult a trusted agent to value it for you. That is why it is very easy to value a property. So the real estate agent are the ones to consult concerning the property, and they will provide you with an accurate estimate since they have specialized knowledge concerning that area. But it is also important to know that prices change every minute and every day. This is when it comes to the stock markets. It is very difficult to evaluate a certain stock belonging to a particular company. So you cannot really tell if you are paying less or too much for a stock. That is why most people have invested in real estate than investment in the stock market. It is very easier to conduct a thorough inspection of the property before making any purchasing decision. You are just required to discuss with the real estate agent, then examine the neighborhood and lastly evaluate it. That is why it is easier to invest in real estates than even in a company. Because it is really hard for just an ordinary shareholder to conduct an inspection in a company. Therefore, this is one of the benefits that you can enjoy with real estate. It is acceptable to negotiate buying the real estate below the market value. However, this does not happen every time, but it also depends on the condition of the owner. Some owners may be desperate others may be facing financial problems. But if the property has a lot of demand then the owner will not agree to sell it below the market price. Therefore, you need to know the condition on the ground to be able to know whether it will allow you to bargain. If you opt to set up your home business, then you are likely to be the manager. Then this means that you really value your own independence. It is essential to note that in a family business you are likely to face some of the challenges that you could have faced in a certain company. Also, your job and life might be complicated by the dynamics of relatives and friends in the business. Your management will be the key issue to the success of your business. It is more likely that when family members work together, personal and family issues end up interfering with some of the business decisions.

This will require you to have good business management skills that will help you to run your family business effectively. It is clear that you cannot manage to run your family business without your family support. You are therefore required to discuss with them the various demands that are required to be met and the risks involved. Also, you have to tell them some of the standards that should be met such as employing only the qualified people. This is because most of the relatives may want to work even if they do not have the required qualifications. If they are willing to help you and adhere to your rules, then you can consider them. It is important to have a separate room for your business. Ensure that the room is well equipped with the required office equipment. Also, you need to restrict your children from the business room. It is also recommended that you separate phone lines for your office and home. Ensure that you have instructed your family members on how to answer some of the calls that are in your absence. It is essential also to ensure that each family member in the business has the right attitude. You should ensure that all family members accepts and understands that the responsibilities and roles are different at home than at work. They should understand that at work, the objectives or goals of the business must be paramount. At home family interests and relationships are the major concerns. It is advisable to know that decisions are mostly concerned in a family business. hat will help you in some of the roles that require a particular know how. Therefore, it is recommended that you consider a non-family member who is qualified for the job.

Bang, Bang, Bang! One of our most popular units is this gorgeous straight wig with dope bangs! We construct these units with the bangs a little longer so that you can frame them to shape your face perfectly. If you leave the bangs a little on the longer side you can also do a side bang as well. As majority of our units are full lace wig, this unit works perfectly for a high elegant bun. we always leave the bangs much longer so customers can free cut it into any length they wanna.if you have any bangs length and width requirements,just leave message please. This is the best wig I’ve ever had. Wear with the blunt bangs for a “look,” and part it to the side for a more subdued appearance. I’ll be purchasing more wigs from this company for sure. I\'m love with my new unit! Thanks for excellent customer service as well! This is my first wig from RPG Show and let me say that I am a happy customer. I have received so many compliments. This unit is worth the money, the Yaki texture is great and soft. I can\'t wait for my next wig to arrive. Thanks Tina. Thank you rpg show, I love the wig!! In love with my wig! This is a raw picture. Literally, 1 hour after I got it! Thank you! Thanks to all of you so much for making such a beautiful wig...I\'ve gotten so many compliments already...will definitely be purchasing again... Happy new year! This is the 5th unit I\'ve bought from RPGSHOW. It\'s one of my favorites! I get lots of compliments on this units. The Yaky texture definitely adds the extra fabulousness! This unit has a natural shine and look to it, which I truly admire ?? My wig is great! Thanks. Looking to purchase the Rhianna inspired wig next! I just wanted to let you know that I have received my wig (PTS001) and am quite happy with it. I also bleached and dip dyed the hair dark teal. I attached a picture of me wearing the unit. I'm loving them! I have been rocking the bang unit now. I have pics on my Instagram. Mostly all of my units on there are rpgshow. Thank you for the unit. I am enjoying so far and everyone loves it. Here are some pictures of me with it. Here are my pics. Hope to buy another wig soon but need a big discount. This is my fourth wig. I am working on perfecting this wig. Also, includes some pics of the older wig( the first 3). The last two are the new wig. I received one of your wigs today as a Christmas gift. It looks great but I was wondering are they normally so thin. I placed it in a pony tail and the density seems extremely low to me. I have some of your other units to compare it to and I also compared it to some of the units you sent gurus and you can tell the difference in the thickness between the units. I don't know maybe my unit was a just a faulty one on the thinner side or if this is just the normal density? I have received my wigs and they are very nice. I will send pictures and once I have them styled. One of the wigs still had the combs in it when i had asked below to have no combs but its okay. And the other one with the bangs is a little too thin in density but it is okay because i will have my hairstylist put a weave/tracks in it to make it a little bit thicker/fuller. It is okay. And guess what they did not send me any brushes at all. You can check my order and see that. I love the rpgshow brushes so much for the wigs. The brushes are so good. Do you think they can send two to go with each wig I just bought? I hope so. Thank you for the gorgeous wig! !! Im very impressed! !! I hope to be ordering another unit very soon . Im so pleased, thanks again Rpgshow! This is Sharon I just want to say thank you. I received my wig right on time for my birthday n it's everythg I wanted it to be. The wig is very beautiful I have attached picture to show you. Thanks you all at rpgshow. I do like the wig. Thanks so much! I love this wig! The bangs come very long so you can cut them to your liking and unit fits very snug. It was also delivered very quickly. Will order again! I absolutely love this unit! I've gotten many compliments on this unit! Everyone is loving my new look and I'm addicted!!! I get so many compliments on my wig. Here's some pictures of my new wig and a picture of one of my other wig that i won for RPGShow for Christmas 2013 PTS001-s. THANKYOUUUU RPGSHOW FOR THIS WIG!!! Love it!!! It looks so natural, no shedding. This wig is everything and too fabulous. It has saved my life! I absolutely love this wig! The hair quality is great, very full 200% density & minimum shedding. I did not get to use my Wig Knot Healer because it was melted but it seems very similar to make-up. Also, I was not able to get my wig hair texture in Yaki hair, so I had to get the silk hair texture but it still exceeded my expectations. I have been wearing my wig for about 6 months and it has lasted through every vacation that I went on this summer- including ocean swims and all kind of madness I have been doing lol. When it is wet it waves up and dry's beautifully. I was able to put it in a ponytail for a little & everything. The bangs come long but you can cut it to whatever length you desire. I will be ordering ordering another (although I can continue to wear the one I have) I just want a new wig; I'll donate this one. I found a site that I can rely on and I will be getting all my wigs from here. I would provide pictures but I do not see that option available. This is the best wig I’ve ever had. Wear with the blunt bangs for a “look,” and part it to the side for a more subdued appearance. I’ll be purchasing more wigs from this company for sure. I received it and I love it!!!! I brought this hair.. 20 inches..... it lasts many many years!! One year I wore it for 1 year straight, but I buy one each year for back up !!! Quality is the best.... u will not be disappointed!!!! For as long as this hair last, you are actually SAVING Money !!! The wig is very beautiful and I love it!!!

Akar: Work closely with businesses. VCE is using day two of GITEX TECHNOLOGY WEEK 2015 to announce that Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has selected a VCE Vblock system for its Automated Collection System (ACS). The RTA’s ACS is a contactless smart card scheme for customers using public transport facilities. The smart cards function as an electronic wallet, and customers using public transport services – such as taxis and park facilities – can pay for services through the pre-loaded card. The Vblock system will form the foundation of the IT infrastructure supporting ACS. It will provide a range of IT applications, including web application, databases and test and development workloads for the RTA’s business segments. The RTA needs a highly available infrastructure for mission critical applications, an IT environment that enables mixed workloads, and integrates compute, storage and network technologies. Another requirement is a future-proof solution that enables RTA to retain and maximise its investments, and increase user productivity, scalability and availability.
Professor Raj Bhala and KU Media Productions recently produced two video clips used to promote two books Professor Bhala wrote. The two videos reside on the Lexis Nexis website as well as the KU YouTube Channel. The material for the video clips was produced by KU Media Productions and the editing of the two clips was to be performed by Lexis Nexis. The goal for the two Lexis Nexis​ videos was to promote the two books to law professors around the world. Professor Bhala was also interested in KU Media Productions editing a version that would not only promote the books, but also speak to the graduate student and research opportunities and coursework at the KU School of Law. Upon watching the KU videos, representatives from Lexis Nexis requested permission to use these videos rather than recreate a similar video. At the conclusion of the project, Professor Bhala shared the following email with colleagues. At KU Media Productions, we appreciate Professor Bhala's emphasis on YouTube as an effective means of dissemination and hope you will agree with his position. His videos, which reside on the KU YouTube Channel, are also linked to the Lexis Nexis YouTube Channel. As parents, aunties, and uncles, many of us are familiar with our kids, nieces, and nephews visiting the YouTube Top 10 website. It is certainly a common hit for Shera after she finishes her Bishop Seabury Academy homework. As we know, the same phenomenon is increasingly common among current and prospective future law students. That is partly why our colleague, Mindie Paget, and others, work hard to raise the KU Law profile around the world through social media outlets. Law students look for information about textbooks, courses, and -- of course -- law schools, on sites like YouTube. So, it was a delight to learn that some legal publishers, including LexisNexis, upload to YouTube "Author's Videos." These Videos are short clips about a textbook or casebook, with the Author as presenter. The publishers appreciate that to write a book, but not promote it energetically in dignified ways through social media -- ways that in the past might have been dubbed unseemly salesmanship -- is to consign the book (however good) to a dusty shelf. Such video clips are a fun, but not undemanding, challenge! To produce two 4-minute video clips took about 3 hours of film shooting. Acting really is physically hard work! And, condensing a book into a short segment for social media, and working in sound bites as to why KU Law is a great place at which to study, took preparatory thought. Of special significance is that all such clips are more than about the book and author. They are about the institution, its students, and its overall atmosphere. So, in an age of low-cost marketing via social media, the clips are a golden opportunity for the KU Law School. If I recall correctly, back around September 1985, the Journal of Legal Education ranked the KU Law School Number 4 in the country among all law schools (private and public), based on the quality of its senior faculty, and Strong Hall put out a proud press release. Recently, as set out in the HLS alumni magazine, Harvard Law School launched its first on-line course, in Intellectual Property. Connecting such dots actually offers hope: with YouTube and other possibilities, the playing field is a bit more level, and we can reach far beyond our region, across the country and overseas.
A French company has come under fire for making teddy bears with real animal fur. The luxurious soft toy manufacturer "Histoire de Bêtes" makes its teddies with rabbit, mink and coypu fur, with an added piece of crocodile skin for the teddy bear's nose. Prices can reach up to €1,800 per teddy. The company prides itself on producing its toys "with love", saying that each toy comes with an "extra soul and softness". However, news that these teddies are made with real animal fur has left a bitter taste in the mouths of many. "How could someone give a child a teddy bear made of real fur? It sullies their innocence," one tweeter said. The Twitter user below said the company was "disgraceful" and called for a boycott. Over 40,000 people have signed online petitions calling for the company to stop making the toys. The director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, Céline Sissler-Bienvenu, said: "I really regret that this company is so far behind. Society's views have changed." Histoire de Bêtes said in a statement that it only worked with French fur makers, adding that it was the fur farmers abroad who sometimes lacked welfare measures. A spokeswoman from animal rights group L214, however, told The Local that animals were mistreated in France too. "In the cases that we've witnessed in France, fur is produced in factory farms where the animals are kept inside tiny cages in appalling conditions," she said. She added that using real animal fur was "completely unnecessary". Clothes manufacturers around the world have given up on using fur, including H&M and TopShop, and more recently The Kooples and Georgio Armani.
Everyone who is in chat during a stream will get Awesome Points (AP). Check how many you have with the !points command. You can see the top 5 with !top5points. Currently, AP are only usable for Song Requests, skips, and vetos. However, future features will require the spending of points as well. For every so many points, you go up in rank. If you’re a subscriber, you get a Dedicated version of the rank. If you’re a moderator, you get a Watchful version. Currently, there are ten levels of ranks, but I won’t reveal how many points each one requires. Try to reach the top! You can earn Regular status by being active in streams on a regular basis. When you become a regular, I’ll (try to) let you know. To check if you’re a regular, use the !regular command. If you are, you’ll get a message – otherwise, you’ll get no response. Regulars get additional benefits like the ability to vote to skip Song Requests. Note that I may on occasion clean up the AP list. When this happens, anyone who hasn’t seen a stream for over two months will lose all their AP. Next time they watch a stream, they’ll start from zero.
 USA  2011  84m   Directed by: Andrew Bellware.  Starring: Robin Kurtz, Walter Barnes, Joe Beuerlein, Greg Oliver Bodine, Nat Cassidy, Lisa Marie Fabrega, Alaina Hammond, Katie Hannigan, Alana Jackler, David Ian Lee, Stacey Raymond, Lucy Rayner, Thomas Rowen.. Robin Kurtz stars as Helen, a woman who wakes up naked in a space station orbiting Earth about being indisposed for the previous 200 years. Having no idea of who see is or what's happening, she spends the remaining movie time trying to get out of the ship while fighting other robots, humans as well as horribly CGI'd monsters. I found this to be an amateurish mish-mash of a handful of sci-fi clichés that wears out its welcome rather quickly. It's no surprise to me in the least that the same person responsible for this travesty was also the one who 'graced' us with 'Battle New York: Day 2' Both of which are available on Streaming Netflix in case you're feeling especially masochistic.

Starting November 16th in Chicago. Independent guru Freddie Gibbs has enjoyed an illustrious ride on the underground circuit for roughly 15-years. A musical stalwart, Gibbs has released five official studio albums, supplemented by his collection of acclaimed mixtapes–like the popular Baby Face Killa. A rapper’s rapper, Gibbs increased his star power with his most recent release, the eponymous Freddie. A 10-track offering, Freddie is a succinct album that serves as an autobiography of sorts–a deep dive into what makes Freddie, Freddie. With only three total features, including an assist from LA’s 03 Greedo on “Death Row”, a track that interpolates Eazy-E’s “Boyz-N-Tha-Hood”, Freddie allows Gibbs to spread his artistic wings, providing fans with an authentic lens into his life and mind. Now, Freddie is taking his album on the road for the “Freddie Tour”. Starting on November 16th in Chicago, the tour will span 19-cities, finishing on December 15th in Seattle. Tickets can be purchased here. Video: Freddie Gibbs – "F**kin’ Up the Count"
When it comes to religion, there’s been a rise of the nones: those who consider themselves atheists, agnostic or non affiliated with a religion. Of the women entering STEM careers today, 45 percent of them will be gone from the STEM field by the time they turn 40. We’ll revisit a conversation from 90.7’s Sunshine Week series about the gender and race disparity in engineering faculty in Florida. And Albert Manero, who co-founded the non-profit Limbitless Solutions while still a student at the UCF, spoke to the United Nations this week. Manero was part of a panel for International Day of Persons With Disabilities. We listen back to an interview with Manero and Dr. Albert Chi about a clinical trial to test the next generation of 3D printed arms.
PRE-ORDER AND GET $250 OF FREE EXTRAS!! Our Master Bundle just got better for a strictly limited time. Get in quick because stock won't last long! Awesome! The 'FORGE' is everything it is advertised to be- Great steak done quickly and easily...... Very professional back-up service from the team. Thanks guys! Fist weekend with my grill I cooked Porterhouse, roasted veggies, nacho's and melted cheese and chorizo. It is amazing at cooking steaks. Next to experiment with is pizza. Hope the company comes out with a pizza stone shelf or attachment in the mean time I found a round stone that will fit and its of to experiment. Thanks again for a summer full of fun cooking ahead. Hands down the best grill/bbq I've ever used. Was initially worried that it wasn't big enough with only two burners but the burners are big and this thing cranks out the perfect steaks in less than 5 minutes. Previously had a 6 burner Beefeater but as soon as I threw my steaks on the Beefeater the grill plates would drop in temp and the sear was unimpressive. This just doesn’t happen on the Forge. Very impressive! Simple put a awesome thing. The quality is second to none & the taste is unbelievable. Well worth the price. Great job Searsmiths.

Amagami has been a pleasant surprise. For what is essentially a generic dating sim scenario it’s be really quite entertaining. Kitto Ashita wa is the series’ second ED and it features my favorite character so far. This entry was posted in Music Spotlight, Spotlight and tagged amagami, Anime, kitto ashita wa, Music, Spotlight, ss. Bookmark the permalink. I’m still shocked you had something positive to say about a romance anime! Finished the series now, but i’ma need to think about my favorite route. They were mostly pretty good. I’ll write one up once i’ve finished the second season. As for the VN…it’s being translated but i’m not sure i’d enjoy it as much as the anime (which is weird!).

The Global Tech Race heralding the Fourth Industrial Revolution is moving at a break neck pace. In order for the Nigerian tech ecosystem not to be spitting dust in the wake of global tech leaders, decisive steps need to be taken to bridge this ever-widening technological gap. According to a recent report from the World Economic Forum, rapid technological development has been recognised as a key source of growth and opportunity in the global economy. This has sparked fierce competition between both public and private actors who strive to lead the market on Artificial intelligence, Internet of things, Nanotechnology, Robotics, among others. In the past 15 years global research and development capacity has increased significantly. This has been fuelled by the rapid increase in expenditure on research and development by emerging economies. China particularly has made science and technology a cornerstone of its developmental policy, it ranks second globally in research and development spending and accounts for 20% of total world expenditure in this field. It also has the highest number of undergraduates globally pursuing science and engineering degrees and has awarded more PhD’s in natural science and engineering than any other country. As a result of this, China is now a firm contender in the global tech race at 2nd place and is rapidly bridging the gap with the United States of America which has traditionally been in the lead in global tech. These stats make a case for digital education as a catalyst for technological advancement, towards ensuring that a nation’s digital economy and tech ecosystem remains vibrant and globally competitive. In line with this, RIV Tech Creek ‘s Codegaminators Junior programme under its Junior Tech Creek programme is a laudable initiative. RIV Tech Creek is an initiative by the Rivers State Government created with the aim of developing tech talents to ensure a vibrant tech ecosystem. With future generations in mind, this initiative has in turn birthed the Junior Tech Creek programme which has a mandate to equip future generations with valuable digital skills. The Codegaminators Junior programme under Junior Tech Creek was created for kids and teens between the ages of 9 and 16 to develop Rivers State’s next generation Techies. This is in recognition of the importance of exposing the future generation early to technology education. This initiative is a step in the right direction as it portends a vibrant and globally competitive tech ecosystem for present and future generations. Codegaminators Junior contributes to fulfilling the skilled talents and Culture components of the Tech Ecosystem. This programme if sustained will ensure that the tech ecosystem continues to have a pool of skilled talents that will ensure it remains sustainable. The introduction of future generations to the tech entrepreneurship ecosystem also fulfils the Culture component of the inputs of a vibrant ecosystem as future generations will more readily adopt Tech Entrepreneurship , this in turn will develop a vibrant and competitive tech ecosystem. If our local tech ecosystem could adopt a lesson from the rise of China in the global tech race, it should be its prioritization of science and technology a cornerstone of its developmental policy and its robust investment in science and technology education. Adopting this locally could give our local tech ecosystem a chance to make an impression in the global tech race and initiatives such as Codegaminators Junior is a right step in the right direction.
Many compliance officers look at the cloud with suspicion, concerned with just how much data they can move there and still maintain cloud compliance. The central issue here is exposing critical data to interception, as well as preventing the loss of data. This poses a difficult challenge: data in motion, either on a local area network (LAN) or the Internet, needs the same rock-solid protection regardless of the transport mechanism being used. This, in itself, is difficult because the security solutions used with LANs are more robust and controllable than those available over the Internet. The security imbalance prevents compliance-bound data from traveling over the Internet and so prevents the use of low-cost cloud services. The answer to this imbalance lies in applying effective security solutions to each element involved in the storage and transmission of data. This is relatively simple for compliance officers to accomplish on the local level, but much more difficult to accomplish in the cloud. Simply put, if the level of protection for data is consistently enforced throughout its journey, then cloud compliance shouldn’t be a problem. The key element becomes the creation, application, enforcement and secure the cloud for compliance purposes, it is important for compliance officers to make sure a security solution offers scalability, automation and auditing, and has adequate speed to meet traffic needs. It is the cloud, ironically, that creates the security problems, but it takes a cloud service to solve them. When looking to secure the cloud for compliance purposes, it is important for compliance officers to make sure a security solution offers scalability, automation and auditing, and has adequate speed to meet traffic needs. It is the cloud, ironically, that creates the security problems, but it takes a cloud service to solve them. All is not lost. Security technology, working hand-in-hand with policy-driven enforcement, is starting to transform into cloud-based services. For example, Cloud Passage, a cloud services company, has ambitions to transform how security is accomplished across a broad, multi-connected enterprise using commonly accepted concepts. CloudPassage’s approach to the problem is an interesting one compared to those of its competitors. It uses SaaS to secure public and private clouds, which allows its product to serve as a virtualized firewall, but also to enforce security policies to servers anchoring both private and public clouds. This hybrid approach will enable delivery of security solutions that meet cloud compliance needs, while still allowing businesses access to clouds.

T444E/AT545 Maintenance List and Tips. Engine, Drive line, and Suspension maintenance list and tips from our school bus conversion. T444E engine with Allison AT-545 Transmission. Bus Maintenance can be a bit frightening to some, but it really doesn’t need to be. Here are a few suggestions, tips, and words of wisdom to help get or keep your dream alive and rolling. Even the most novice of mechanics can learn to service their rig in a very basic way. Filters, Fluids, and the other pieces that keep your engine, transmission and suspension in good working order are really some of the easiest parts to replace. This post is based on the maintenance we have done on our 2000 International 3800 with a T444E engine and Allison AT-545 Transmission. Air Filter – Air flow is important to the engine as it is a needed element for combustion as well as being used to cool various fluids as air moves across radiators. The Turbo on the T444E engine also needs air intake to operate. Originally we ordered our air filter through Rock Auto, but the wrong one. No Bueno. We decided after that to order OEM from the dealer. This thing is pretty big. It was $85, but well worth it. The old filter was filthy and covered in dirt, dust, and wasp carcasses. Replacing the filter is as simple as loosening a bolt on the filter box, taking the ring off, removing the old filter element and inserting the new one. Put the ring back on, tighten it all down and you are done. Oil Filter – Oil is the blood of the engine; it is one of the most important fluids and should be maintained regularly. An oil change is a good idea (and super easy to do) as soon as you get your bus, even if the previous owner says it was just serviced, change it, write down your mileage and keep a watch on your oil level and condition. While the oil itself can be expensive, especially when you have 5 gallons of it to fill, the filters are inexpensive and easy to replace. We are using a Motorcraft FL- 1995 (F4TZ-6731-A) on our bus. Thermostat was faulty. When we removed the old thermostat there was almost nothing left of it. We sourced the thermostat online as the ones we were getting from Auto Zone and the like were all wrong. After our issues with getting the right parts from the standard auto parts stores we recommend NOT using them, call the dealer or a repair shop and source parts. They will know better what fits and what you need. We were able to find a slightly used one for $35 + 13 for Shipping. You can see the difference in the picture as to what is supposed to look like next to what we pulled out. The part number I have for this is #NAV1845804C2 or Item # 481828. The filter we have is Part # FD-4595. The function of a fuel filter is to strain out dirt and contaminants from engines. If the straining does not occur, the dirt, grim and contaminants can act as a stopper and significantly reduce the amount of flowing fuel into the engine. Reducing the amount of flowing fuel means the engine’s performance is going to decrease until the clog is cleared out of the filter. With diesel engines the fuel is strained and any water that may be in the water is seeped down and released without going into the engine itself. to release the fuel and water in the bowl and surrounding the filter. Grab something to catch the fluid and DO NOT put it back in the bowl after replacing the filter. Transmission Filter – The transmission filter we ordered from the dealer. Part # – . It is a good idea with all the other filters being replaced to just go ahead and do this one as well. It also allows you to see the condition of the fluid in the filter and what comes out when you pull the old filter off. If you notice the fluid is darker than normal or see any indication of metal in the fluid I would recommend draining the system and replacing the fluid completely, you may also opt to have the transmission serviced or checked out by a reputable mechanic if you feel the condition warrants further investigation. Front Shocks – When we bought our bus the previous owner had driven from Mississippi to Florida with a shock that had separated at the bottom mount. I ordered a set of Monroe shocks from Rock Auto. Fairly inexpensive and a simple install. The worst of it is getting the old shock off. If you can, use an pneumatic impact driver to loosen the nuts on top and bottom. We also used a larger pipe wrench to hold the body of the shock in place as we were removing the nuts. The new shocks came with new bushings and nuts. With the shock being broken the driver side tire had worn down pretty badly and needed to be replaced. Tire wear is a big indication that something may be wrong with your shocks as well as other suspension parts. Front suspension seals and grease fittings – While greasing the suspension I noticed a few seals that needed to be replaced. We ordered OEM seals and installed them ourselves. The lower drag link seal on the door side had been obliterated and needed to be replaced. I also replaced an upper king pin bushing on the driver side. Greasing the suspension and steering parts is a good idea to ensure they can operate freely and as intended. A grease gun and grease can be purchased rather cheaply at Harbor Freight (that’s where we got ours). One tip is to make sure that the fitting you are putting grease into isn’t actually a fitting to bleed the brakes… I say that from experience. Its a bad idea. Rear End / Differential Fluid – This is a simple thing to check and fill as well. On the rear transmission housing or differential, between the rear wheels on our bus, there is a ¾ inch nut. Loosen the nut slowly, as the nut gets to the end you may get some fluid that seeps out. That is a good thing. Replace the nut, tighten it down to torque specs and you are done. However, if you do not get fluid coming out, even when you take the nut off completely, you will want add fluid. Differential fluid is just as important as the transmission fluid so make sure to check them both and fill as necessary. The AT545 is fickle as it is, so lets be good to it and hopefully she will be good to us. Transmission Cooler – Another thing we did to mitigate the apparent nature of the AT545 we decided to add a transmission cooler to aid in keeping this baby at optimal operating temperature. We installed a Hayden Automotive 679 Rapid-Cool Plate and Fin Transmission Cooler we found on Amazon here is a link for it. The Transmission oil cooler is installed so that the fluid comes from the transmission to this cooler and then to the factory cooler/warmer. This circuit ensures that the fluid is at the right temperature no matter the weather or load we are putting on it. It is highly recommended to install an extra cooler on the 545. In the end the best thing you can do to keep your rig running right is to perform routine maintenance and the cheapest way to do it is to do it yourself. All of the maintenance we have done has been rather simple but extremely necessary. Remember to take notes on what filters and fluids you use and the intervals you are changing them.

Since the industrial revolution of the late 1700s, the business world has generated more pollution, mostly via product production, than any other force on the planet. Only recently have we come to understand just how deeply that pollution effects us and the planet. From climate change to untimely deaths (air pollution alone kills an estimated 7 million people each year, according to the World Health Organization) pollution is a huge problem. In 2014, researchers at Columbia, USC, and UC San Diego even found that pollution makes us less productive at work, particularly when that work involves any kind of physical labor. As a modern business owner, you have a great opportunity. You can learn from the mistakes of past businesses, and take action to ensure that your business is run in such a way that it doesn't harm the environment or contribute to the planet's pollution problem. Whether you own your own office space or rent space within an existing building, there are ways to improve your business's infrastructure in order to make it more energy efficient and reduce its carbon footprint. If you own your own building, take the time to research and invest in electrical appliances that use less energy. Though the upfront cost of such items may be higher than normal, it will pay dividends in the long run in the form of decreased energy bills for your business. Another simple way to reduce your business's carbon footprint and improve its' energy efficiency? Proper lighting. LED lights might be more expensive than traditional bulbs, but they'll pay for themselves over time through lowered energy cost. And because most electricity is produced in ways which produce CO2, using less electricity means lowering your carbon footprint. It's one of the basics of green living, but there's plenty of ways to make sure your office is just as eco-friendly as your home. Did you know that ink cartridges from printers are a particularly problematic kind of waste, with roughly 375 million ink and toner cartridges thrown away per year? Luckily, there are recyclers who specialize in recycling ink cartridges, and even printer companies that will collect empty cartridges and reuse them as a regular business practice. Things like phones (both mobile and desk phones), computers, refrigerators, microwaves and even printers themselves can be reused or recycled. It may not always be possible, but whenever an opportunity arises for employees to work remotely, try to take it. Before flying or driving in a client or remote workers, ask yourself if an e-conference would suffice just as well. Not only will this reduce your business's environmental impact by saving the fuel your employees would have used to travel to work, but it may well raise your employees' productivity as well. Research conducted in 2014 suggests that workers may be up to 13% more productive when allowed to work from home. Allowing employees to work remotely will also save money in the form of unused printer ink, electricity and other resources. These days, it is easy to save money in this way without even having to sacrifice the basics of face-to-face communication and meaningful collaboration. If running a green business is important to you, then it should be important to your staff as well. You can ensure this is the case by making eco-friendliness central to your corporate culture. Integrate eco-friendly language into your business' mission statement and onto its website. Develop staff guidelines that encourage your employees to go green. Remind employees to turn off computers, printers, and overhead lights when they're not in use and make sure that all staff has access to recycling bins, both near their desks and at a centralized location. Encourage employees to bring their lunch to work in reusable containers, and offer incentives for workers to use public transportation, carpool together, or ride their bike instead of driving.

On October 28, 2009, President Obama signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (FY 2010 NDAA). The new law amends the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provisions applicable to military personnel and their families by expanding the availability of both qualifying exigency leave and military caregiver leave. Previously, qualifying exigency leave was not available to family of active members of the Armed Forces, but only to family members of those in the National Guard or Reserves who are deployed in support of a contingency operation. The FY 2010 NDAA extends the availability of qualifying exigency leave to family members of both career service members and those in the National Guard or Reserves who are deployed to a foreign country. In addition to qualifying exigency leave, the FMLA provides up to 26 weeks of FMLA leave during a 12-month period for spouses, children, parents or next of kin to care for current members of the Armed Forces, including members of the National Guard or Reserves, who are undergoing medical treatment, recuperation or therapy, or are otherwise on the temporary disability retired list for a serious injury or illness incurred in line of duty. The FY 2010 NDAA extends this entitlement to family members of veterans of the Armed Forces, including the National Guard or Reserves, suffering from a service-related injury or illness if the veteran was an active member of the Armed Forces within five years of requiring care. Presumably, this extension is intended to assist veterans who sustain injuries or illnesses during active duty that are not immediately apparent, such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Additionally, the FY 2010 NDAA expands military caregiver leave to cover the care of members of the Armed Forces who have an existing or preexisting serious injury or illness incurred in the line of duty that is aggravated by active duty. This expansion will likely allow for family members to take multiple 26-week periods of leave related to the same injury or illness of a covered service member if the injury or illness is first sustained in the line of duty and then aggravated during a return to active duty. While the FY 2010 NDAA does not contain an effective date, employers should consider the law to be effective immediately. Employers should be alert to upcoming changes in the regulations and should update all FMLA policies to reflect the changes associated with the FY 2010 NDAA. If you have any questions about this or any other labor & employment matters, please contact your Husch Blackwell Sanders attorney.

Home Sports Manchester United v Valencia: Champions League – live! Manchester United v Valencia: Champions League – live! What does Paul Scholes make of Jose Mourinho at the moment? “I’m surprised that he survived Saturday. I think his mouth is out of control and I think he’s embarrassing the club,” the former Manchester United midfielder says on BT Sport. Ouch. That’s as brutal as one of his tackles. Manchester United make four changes after Saturday’s defeat to West Ham. Antonio Valencia replaces Ashley Young and Eric Bailly is in for Victor Lindelof at the back. Marcus Rashford starts after his goal at the London Stadium and Alexis Sanchez has walked straight back into the side after being left out entirely against West Ham. Out go Scott McTominay and Anthony Martial. Valencia shake things up after beating Real Sociedad on the weekend. Ruben Vezo, Mouctar Diakhaby, Toni Lato, Carlos Soler, Denis Cheryshev and Kevin Gameiro make way for Cristiano Piccini, Gabriel Paulista, Jose Gaya, Francis Coquelin, Goncalo Guedes and Rodrigo Moreno.

I'm looking for measurement of placing the seat, sticks and pedals and the distances between them. Whatever dimensions you end up using, remember that if you can't smell what the co-pilot had for breakfast, you have too much space in the cockpit. The best solution is ... go to Beauvechain ... with a meter ... en alles ter plekke opmeten. Send a email to the Base Commander for an admission. Should be no problem. Contact Paul Kellens for the coordinates. I don't know if this helps any, since the cockpit has been heavily modified, but this is what I flew a few years ago. All that extra gear is for Sony commercial camera systems and gunsighting. Here's a nice image of the SF260 cockpit.

After the longest shutdown in government history, Congress has until February 15, to figure out how to fund the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Without a lasting agreement to keep the government funded, departments funded by the remaining seven spending bills will shut down again, while other critical programs continue to linger under threat from the President’s demand for more than $5 billion for a border wall that simply cannot pass Congress. It is critically important that Congress work together to avert another government shutdown while protecting the rights and dignity of migrants, border residents, and vulnerable communities across the nation. Click here to send an email to your members of Congress. We need people of faith to urge their members of Congress to pursue a long-term solution without further militarizing our border or shutting down the government.Additional funding for Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs & Border Protection (CBP) will worsen our punitive immigration system and put more people in harm’s way. Instead, Congress should invest in alternatives to detention, such as community-based case management, and more humane policies and practices along the border. Further, ICE and CBP should be prohibited from overspending appropriations or repurposing other agencies’ funding for detention, border wall construction, or expanded immigration enforcement. There is a group of legislators tasked with coming up with a compromise piece of legislation for Department of Homeland Security spending. If you are represented by the people below, your voice is especially important. However, it is important for you to reach out to your members of Congress no matter where you live, so that they can weigh in with their colleagues on what they are hearing from their own constituents (you). What should you say to your legislators? Your legislators should hear from you that you want them to significantly reduce money for deportation, detention, and border militarization and walls. Click here to email your members of Congress. As a person of faith, I urge Congress to negotiate and pass a spending package that protects the rights and dignity of migrants, border communities, and vulnerable communities across the nation affected unfairly by the longest shutdown in our nation’s history. I believe that Congress should be focused on significantly reducing funding for deportation, detention, and border militarization and walls. Our tax dollars should be spent alleviating poverty and investing in our future – not rounding up our neighbors or locking out people seeking asylum. Any new DHS funds must not further militarize the border, but rather invest in alternatives to detention and other community-based solutions. Further, ICE and CBP should be prohibited from overspending appropriations or repurposing other agencies’ funding for detention, border wall construction, or expanded immigration enforcement. I urge you to work with your colleagues across the aisle to restore good governance and reject the President’s harmful immigration enforcement demands under threat of another shutdown. The federal workforce is not a bargaining chip. This nation’s immigrant community is not a bargaining chip. I urge you to reject the use of people’s livelihoods in a game of political brinksmanship. 1. Visit our website here. 2. Click here to sign up for our e-mail alerts!
Australian sexual consent campaign, 50 Shades of No, has been shortlisted for the Glass Lion: The Lion for Change. It’s the only Australian campaign on the list and is one of 27 global campaigns nominated for this prestigious award. The Glass Lion is the Lion for Change; an award that recognises work that challenges gender bias and shatters stereotypical images of men and women in marketing messages. 50 Shades of No is the product of a group of Melbourne women, and agency, The Otto Empire. To find out more about the initiative, B&T sat down with the executive producer of 50 Shades of No and Otto Empire founder Jo de Fina. What was your inspiration for 50 Shades? The idea came about as a response to the Aziz Ansari scandal, and after considering how we would respond to the International Women’s Day call out to #pressforprogress. In January an article was published with the account of a girl named Grace who had had the ‘worst night of her life’ during a date with US comedian Aziz Ansari. It opened up a huge debate about consent and what it looks like. We realised that consent has a lot of grey areas and wanted to start a conversation about the spaces in between the black and white of consent; it’s not as straightforward as no means no. How was the idea put into action? We put a Facebook post out asking women to share occasions when they had tried to say stop or slow down a sexual encounter without using the words. We received hundreds of statements from women from around the world. We then took 50 of those statements and created T-shirts which were made available for sale on an e-commerce site. And we asked 50 influencers to wear and post a pic on International Women’s Day. Our aim was to start a conversation about consent, and in particular, enthusiastic consent. Not only have we started a conversation about consent, but we have had contact with other countries and organisations wanting to replicate the idea in their own region. We’re also in conversations with universities and various festivals and support groups about consent education and how to change the conversation. Ultimately we would love to see legislation changed as to what constitutes consent. The Saxon Mullins case in NSW highlights the need for this clear understanding of what consent is. It’s not just hearing someone say ‘No’. There are many ways we communicate, and this campaign is about those subtleties of that communication. What has been the benefit of using such a diverse group of women to demonstrate the issue? We’ve reached a very broad audience. This issue about enthusiastic consent affects everyone; men and women. Women want to be heard and men have been very open to being educated and enlightened as to how we communicate. It’s been educational for everyone. How have you used social media to generate attention? The entire campaign was driven by social media. We’ve used Instagram and Facebook to drive the entire campaign. Recruiting influencers, and having everyone tag and share. What have been the ripple effects? Probably the biggest one is the cathartic and healing effect it seems to have had on people who have experienced sexual assault. Buying and wearing a t-shirt has helped them to heal their own personal experiences, and to communicate both online, and offline, with those around them. And the realisation that it is more than one day, International Women’s Day. The campaign has a life of its own now and education and working with universities and schools is now our focus for stage 2. As well as the global reach. What do you make of the Cannes nom? To be the only Australian work shortlisted for a Glass Lion is amazing. Especially when we look at the company we’re in. We’re a small group of individuals from Melbourne who set out to create a campaign that would start a conversation. We’re in the company of Nike, Coca-Cola, Dove, global agency groups. It’s pretty humbling. How can an event like Cannes help generate attention to this issue? The platform and audience in Cannes is huge, and I intend to use the 20 minutes I have in front of the Jury and delegates, to further callout for support, conversation, and awareness. This is about a conversation and we’re already in discussions with other countries about running their own campaigns. Cannes is a great platform to drive further conversation. We’re in the business of communication and I have a week to communicate with a huge melting pot of people from advertising throughout the world. In an industry driven by consumption, to be able to use creativity to affect change is so rewarding. How intertwined is this issue and the advertising industry in Australia and worldwide? I wouldn’t say the consent conversation is exclusive to any particular industry. It’s about education and how we raise and condition boys and girls. How we represent relationships in the media and conditioning of both sexes from birth. That’s something well outside of any workplace or industry. What is still the biggest hurdle for 50 Shades, and the industry more generally? I think our industry is making great strides in recognising talent of all genders and minorities. I know there are the naysayers about quotas and this whole female push, but it will only be temporary until there is a balance and this ingrained unconscious bias starts dissolving away. Everyone needs to be recognised for their talents, regardless of gender. For so long, women’s gender was clouding any recognition they may have received. Now that is slowly falling away, which is progress. We started 50 Shades of No in response to the International Women’s Day #pressforprogress, and I think we’re slowly getting somewhere.

I called Airstream this morning and gave them my vin number. My Basecamp is part of the recall. Did not sound like they have an immediate fix, as I was told they would call me when they have the solution ironed out to let me know how and where to get it fixed .... that is paraphrasing. I'm recalled too. Airstream told me the "fix" was not known at this time entirely. Probably no need to check your VIN on the NHTSA site. If you have a Basecamp, yours is on the list. All Basecamps manufactured up through the date of the voluntary recall are potentially affected. Airstream has received reports of scuffing on tires. They have tried to replicate the conditions leading to the suspension settling to the point where tires might travel enough to contact the fender flare with both an unloaded and loaded to gross capacity Basecamp but have not been successful yet. It is likely that real world driving conditions such as hittng potholes at speed are the issue. I am assuming the problem is behind the tire instead of above it, as there seems to be ample room above the tire on my camper. Seems to me that modifying the wheel well/fender would be a better approach to allow more room behind it. In my case, the smallest clearance between the fender flare and the tire is toward the front. Given the apparent eccentric swing on the Dexter axle, I would think that the tire would travel away from the front flare as it responds to road irregularities, but there might be another dynamic at play here. Don't own one but could someone crawl underneath and look for the Dexter label. It should have enough info to easily determine the axle rated capacity. Then what is tongue weight, UBW and gross weight. And dexter just supplied a part number to spec I bet. My rig was built with lighter axles than parts book stated. Long story. Got me new axles. Not a lot of room under there folks :-) Photo of my Dexter axle label attached. A month or so back, I took my SUV and camper to a truck stop to weigh it all. The axle of my camper that day weighed 2400 pounds. I didn't have anything loaded in the camper that day. The loaded capacity of the camper is 780 pounds, per the sticker on the inside of my door. I see what you're saying about the space in front of the tire. Not much room. Thanks for the photo, Gail. I see on one of your posts that you mentioned you are a nature photographer… very cool!!! Do you have a website where you post your photos? Oh, and thanks for the contact information for the recall… I will try calling tomorrow. Great photos… especially of Floyd and Fiona. Did you get the additional tents so they each have their own den? I hope they get these issues resolved with the BC… I haven't even used mine yet. Makes me wonder a bit if the issue is axle placement. I have not crawled under to look at the manner in which the axle assembly is attached to the frame, but I kinda wonder if there is fore/aft adjustment in the attachment area. Perhaps moving the axle aft a bit might be the ticket. Then again, if there is only one option for where the axle connects to the frame, then it's on to other theories.
I kept my card pretty simple - blended some Distress ink over a heart-stencil and on the backgroun piece, added the embossing paste on top of the stencil and that's pretty much it. Stamping, coloring, fuzzy cutting, assembling - done! Ich habe meine Karte recht schlicht gehalten - habe nur etwas Distress Ink mit einem Stencil aufgetragen und auch auf dem Hintergrund und habe dann noch die Embossing Paste über den Stencil aufgetragen - das war's auch schon fast. Stempeln, colorieren, ausschneiden, zusammenkleben - fertig! Wow!!!!! LOOOOVE this!!! Those pinks and oranges are INCREDIBLE!! Love the googly eyes too! Ha ha!! This is soooooo happy and lovely!!

It used to be that businesses lost money because nobody bought the product or service being offered. Cars came along and rendered the buggy whip obsolete. Gas logs threaten the existence of chimney sweeps. Falling demand reduces supply over time. It is the natural order of things. What is hard to comprehend, though, is how companies, such as those in the wireless telecom industry, canât seem to make money. Have you noticed all of the people around you using wireless phones, checking e-mail on their PDA, or reading a message on their digital pager? All of these communication devices are now standard-issue equipment in the new urban tool-belt. Forget hammers and tape measures. If you spend any time at all in airports, malls, traffic jams, or other places where large numbers of people gather, you canât help but realize that everyone seems to be talking to someone! With all of this demand, why no profit for the industry? Remember the old Soviet Union? During the cold war, the U.S. engaged the enemy in an arms race that could easily have bankrupted one or both countries. Each country tried to be king of the hill by building a larger and larger network of missiles and other weapons. They kept building even though both already possessed a more-than-adequate supply to wipe out the other and large chunks of the rest of the world as well. The objective had nothing to do with the need for more weapons, but rather it was merely to drive the competition out of business. The wireless industry is locked in a similar and equally deadly game. They are spending too much, unnecessarily. Their networks are large enough to serve their customers; but that is not the goal. The goal is to crush the enemy. Other industries have been doing the same thing in recent years. At some point, corporate America lost its way. Instead of focusing on making a profit and growing market share over time, corporations became determined to rule the world, overnight. This raised the stakes for investors. WorldCom faces a downgrade in its debt ratings that will reduce its credit worthiness to âjunkâ status. Other wireless players face potential bankruptcy. The U.S. stock market pulled back sharply in April in response to problems in the telecom group. Concerns abound as to which companies will survive their own debt loads. As investors, we should be looking for opportunities in the battered industries that have been âre-pricedâ due to these fears. Telecom and pharmaceutical stocks, by example, are looking washed out. It is hard to imagine that the outlook could get any worse or the sentiment any more negative. These and a handful of other industries are reaching a point where external shocks will have little effect. What makes these industries attractive, and what sets them apart from other similarly beat-up groups, is the demand. To be sure, there is no lack of fallen angels to choose from, but many are not worth buying, even at recent low prices. Why? They represent a value trap. On the surface they may appear to be a good value because their price has dropped, but so has the demand for what they sell.
A beautiful torchiere style lamp with traditional styling and alabaster glass, from Kathy Ireland's Sonnett Collection. A traditional torchiere floor lamp from Kathy Ireland Essentials designed with refined appeal and beautiful materials. The base comes in a bronze finish and it's decorated with a sculpted faux marble font and a faux marble accent at the base. This lamp is topped with an alabaster glass shade up top. Ideal for adding warm, general illumination and sophisticated flair to any room. 72" high overall. Base is 12" wide. Torchiere glass is 15" wide. Uses one maximum 150 watt standard-medium base bulb (not included). Foot dimmer switch for easy lighting control. A traditional torchiere floor lamp design from the Kathy Ireland brand. Faux marble accents. Resin construction. Bronze finish base and column. Metal construction. Alabaster glass shade. Our decorating style is Italianate. Beautiful design. Fits well with my living room furniture. Close match to lamp I have. Right size. Right style. Good price. They're perfectly suitable for both my living and dining rooms. 150 watts? I hope they have dimmers. Great looking light, price, and Lamps Plus is a great service oriented company. does it have an on/off switch or just foot dimmer switch? BEST ANSWER: Just the foot dimmer which can be slid all the way to off. Works great! It says it has a foot dimmer switch and yet a reviewer said he wished it had a dimmer switch. I’m confused? BEST ANSWER: Hi - I can confirm this includes a foot dimmer switch for easy lighting control. I always check for a dimmer switch and prefer one on the pole vs. the foot dimmer. what is the diameter of the pole? BEST ANSWER: The pole has an estimated width of 1 3/4" - 2". Seems like a question Lamps Plus should be able to answer. I gave the lamp away before moving from one state to another, but at a guess I'd estimate the diameter of the pole at about 1-½ inches. BEST ANSWER: This lamp weighs 20 lbs. I really like the classic look of this lamp. It has a vintage look to it, with simple lines that keep the lamp from being too busy. I like that the switch is located mid way on the pole so that it is easy to reach . . . not high up on the lamp. The color of the top glass bowl helps the lamp give off a nice warm illumination. I only wish that the lamp's switch was a dimmer so I did not have to buy a floor dimmer switch to make the lamp more versatile. I purchased the sister lamp to this one on sale (mine had a fabric shade). The lamp looks nice enough although I noticed the long shaft seemed crooked. I thought it was the floor until I noticed that where the long lamp shaft screws into the base it did not stand firm. The whole lamp wables where it connects to the base. I tried to screw the shaft into the base further, but it won't tighten. So, the lamp just leans over a bit - depending on which way you want to push it. I would have sent it back, but by the time I paid the shipping charge twice, what's the point. It'll just have to do until I can find something better. Assembly was easy. Lamp is sturdy and well made. Nice design, fit and function for bedroom. I especially like the alabaster amber-toned glass, it gives warmth to the room. I also like the on/off dimmer switch on the pole (wish they made more like this) as opposed to a floor/foot switch) and better than the 3 way switch up top. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Kathy Ireland line, simple but elegant and a wide range of pricing for everyone. Lamp arrived in good shape and went together easily. Seems very sturdy! We are happy with it's looks and operation along with the unbeatable price! Beautiful, well made, easy to assemble and a great price. What more can I say? Really nice light, with a good dimmer. Quality made. Love it in our room. I love the lamp!!! I want another one!!???? My floor lamp I purchased is just perfect in my living room as I have the right lighting in that area. Thank you. I really liked this floor lamp. It goes well with a similar lamp. Thanks again. Such good quality and product I love it ???? Very good quality and perfect in my space. Beautiful. Lamps are perfect. 1 had to be shipped and arrived timely and in great condition. This item shipped perfectly and was easy to assemble. I loved the colors and it seems like it could work with many colors. The light brightens up my room and I can turn it down easily. Well worth the money, great purchase. I purchased two of the lamps, they were well packed and easy to assemble. Very attractive and a great compliment to my family room placed on both sides of the couch. The fact that the lighting is adjustable allowing for just a hint of light or full lighting for reading is a definite plus. After assembly, lamp leans to one side. Do not purchase. Other reviews stated the same problem. Leveling pads just make it look bad at base. Hi Danny G., sorry to hear that your floor lamp leans to one side even when using the leveling pads. Our customer service team would be happy to provide some troubleshooting tips in order for you to enjoy your lamp. Please reach out to them via phone, email, or chat. Thank you. Beautiful but I expected it to last longer than a year. I love this lamp. It’s beautiful and sturdy. However I am very disappointed that after 14 months the very first time the light bulb went out, it also blew the dimmer switch. When I put a new bulb in, not only does it not dim but I can every turn it on or off. I expected better quality/longevity for the price. Hi Carolynn P., so sorry to hear that the bulb went out on your floor lamp and caused some issues with the dimmer. This could be due to the type or wattage of bulb being used, or the electrical issues with the outlet the lamp is connected to. Our customer service team would be happy to look into this for you and assist with troubleshooting, so please reach out to them via phone, email, or chat. Thank you. Unless you're house is a mini-Trump Tower, this is one [ugly] light. Garish, cheap glass, lousy illumination. Kathy, Kathy, Kathy... You ought to be ashamed of yourself, putting your name on a light like this. DOWN TO THE BASEMENT IT GOES!

Has been a contributor to Auto Express, Classic Cars, Classic Car Weekly, Candis magazine and Japanese Motoring. WHEN I drove the Peugeot 5008 seven seat MPV, I thought such a big vehicle might suffer with only a 1.6 diesel engine. But I need not have worried. It never felt short of breath - even on an airport trip when I picked up five adults and all their luggage for a family wedding. Now I know people carriers are supposed to be family friendly, but this one, which was built between 2010 and 2016, has to be one of the most friendly on the market, with loads of space and very flexible seating. It is refined and easy to drive, with either six-speed manual or six-speed automatic gearboxes. I would say the 1.6 or 2.0-litre diesels are the best bet for low running costs, but if you don't do too many miles, one of the petrols will be a good deal cheaper. The 1.6 diesel was available with 112, 115 and 120bhp, and the 2.0-litre with either 150 or 163bhp. The petrol choices were two 1.6 units, earlier with 120bhp and later the excellent THP turbo 1.6 with 156bhp. Performance is fair to good in all, with the earlier 1.6 petrol VTi being the slowest. But as I've said, the 1.6 diesel is more than capable of hauling the 3008 around. Comfort is excellent and it smoothes out even the worst of surfaces on potholed town roads. Yet it also holds the road surprisingly well for a tallish vehicle - well enough to allow for quick progress across country. The rearmost two seats have enough legroom for shorter adults or young teenagers and fold down into the boot floor in about three seconds to give a huge load area. The middle row are individual and adjustable for legroom, and they fold down to make even more loadspace. Equipment is good in all so that even the entry level Active includes air conditioning, 16-inch steel wheels with energy saving tyres, a CD stereo, an electric handbrake and electronic stability control. Sport models add the ‘family pack', which includes storage compartments under the front seats and foot wells, cruise, front fog lights and a lighting pack with boot-mounted torch. Top Exclusive models get a glass roof, 17-inch alloys, climate control, a head-up display, automatic headlamps and wipers, USB, Bluetooth, electric folding mirrors, auto dimming rear-view mirror and rear parking sensors. Pay about Â£6,500 for a '13 13-reg 1.6 diesel Active II, or Â£8,750 for a '15 15-reg Allure 1.6 THP petrol.
Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic illness that affects breathing. It occurs when alpha-1 antitrypsin protein levels are too low. Alpha-1 antitrypsin is produced by the liver and helps lungs function properly. In those who have alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, their oxygen saturation may be lower than normal – they may get sick easier, have weaker immune systems and/or need supplemental oxygen depending on how the illness has progressed. Remember, everyone is different. Oxygen saturation level is below normal during any part of the day. Decline in lung function in short period. Difficulty breathing, shortness of breath and/or wheezing. Chronic bronchitis, chest colds or chronic allergies. Difficulty performing activities due to physical exertion. Mucus production that may or may not cough up on its own. Everyone who suffers with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency does not necessarily have all of the symptoms. I had not heard of this condition, Samantha Bowick . You teach me so much, thank you!

A mold and mildew examination will certainly recognize any kind of conditions around your residential or commercial property which will certainly support mold growth along with determining problem areas for example water damages, odors and obvious indications of fungal growth and so on. The mold examiner ought to take the inspection outside and check the outside of the home again for noticeable indicators of water damage, leaks and their resources such as broken pipelines, busted seamless gutters, fractured block job and more.

The massive transform for the present Honda Insight is it abandoning the awesome liftback appear and transferring to the Honda Civic platform with Honda Accord design cues. This more conventional design vocabulary has gotten carry in the hybrid community, therefore we count on no major graphic changes on the 2020 Insight.

Besides the force-option transmission, the Honda Insight is also free of charge of lots of switches and interfaces to fool around with. Like the exterior, we count on the easy interior format to transport into the 2020 Honda Insight without any changes. Since there are no changes to its seems, we assume no changes to the 2020 Insight’s regular features. If the is real, it would arrive normal with 16-inch rims, LED front lights, a 5-inch audio system show, Bluetooth, a USB harbour, keyless ignition, cloth covers, and much more. Customers trying to find far more features can relocate up to greater trims like the EX and range-topping Touring. We assume no changes to the 2020 Honda Insight’s powertrain. If this type of demonstrates exact, it includes a 107-horsepower 1.5-liter gasoline-powered engine and a 129-hp electric motor. Collectively, these products force 151 hp and 197 pound-feet of torque to the entrance rims without the need of the support of a transmission.

The link between Hollywood and politics has always felt more pronounced than that of the connection that most other industries have to world leaders, mostly because of the profile that big-name Hollywood actors and actresses have. Clint Eastwood once spoke to an empty chair at the Republican National Convention, Sean Penn has done just about everything, including interviewing notorious drug lords for Rolling Stone, and so forth. Leonardo DiCaprio has been outspoken about environmental issues for a long time now, so him hosting a fundraiser for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton should come as no surprise. He had the best intentions this time out, reports Deadline, but something came up and he won’t be able to host the previously-planned August 23rd event at his LA home. That means that those $33,400-a-plate patrons will now be shuffled off to a new, equally-as-ritzy location; the home of Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel. DiCaprio will be in New York filming for an upcoming project and turned to former Mouseketeer, Grammy-award-winning musician and actor pal Justin Timberlake and his equally-talented wife, Jessica Biel, to see if they could pick up his slack while he was across the country. They were happy to oblige and the event will go on as scheduled, just in a new location. This will be just one of many fundraising events that Clinton has planned in the Los Angeles area in the coming week, including one at Magic Johnson’s home and another at Haim Saban’s.

An interesting article on the effect that the presence of men has on laboratory rats and mice, compared with the presence of women. I, personally, have never noticed a difference in the way our rats react around my husband compared with around me, but the article does say that the effect diminishes with time, so maybe it is just an effect when they are getting to know you. I do wonder, however, if this effect plays a role in male vs female veterinarians. Would a rat be less stressed around a female veterinarian? Would he/she be more likely to experience pain around a female veterinarian? I am guessing the effect is insignificant compared with the stress produced just by visiting a strange location with lots of predatory animal smells. My rats have always been nervous visiting the vet, even though our veterinarian is a woman. I will say that I definitely notice this effect in one of our dogs. She is a very good guard dog, but it takes her a while to warm up to new people. It is much easier to get her to relax around women than around men. I think that is a pretty common reaction in dogs, so I can see it carrying over to rats in less obvious ways. Bela had to see the vet for the first time today. She and her sisters turned one year old sometime this month and with turning that corner comes the inevitable appearance of respiratory infections. This week, I started to hear the faint "rubber lung" breathing sounds coming from Bela that unfortunately mean a respiratory infection is starting to catch up with her. With that, come vet trips and the need for a good rat carrier to transport her in. (Bela is now on Baytril and Doxycycline and we will hopefully nip this in the bud). It took us a while to find a good rat carrier. When we got our first rats, I used a small bird carrier I had on hand (similar to the one shown on the left). They are good for babies because the bar spacing is very narrow and the little ratties cannot escape. However, our first boys quickly grew out of that squirmy baby stage and into the big squish stage, and the little bird carriers were way too small. We looked at small animal carriers, but they all were either too small or made from fabric mesh that a determined rat could quickly chew his or her way out of. For a while, I made my own carrier out of a plastic bin, with the plastic cut out of the lid and a small wire panel from a bird cage zip tied over the opening. But this was only a temporary solution. The ventilation was not great and I don't think the rats felt comfortable inside. I saw a carrier like the one we currently have (pictured at the top and below) on an episode of iCarly that my kids were watching. They were using it to hold a ferret and it looked perfect. But I couldn't find a small animal carrier like that anywhere. Turned out, I was looking in the wrong place. In fact, this is a small dog/cat carrier. I found it by accident at Petsmart when they were stacked against the back wall in the clearance section (Petsmart no longer carries this model). I would never have thought to look for it in the dog/cat section. It is the Petmate Look 'N See Kennel and it is still available from Amazon. Of course, in retrospect, it makes sense that a cat carrier would make a good rat carrier, as long as the openings are not too big for a rat to squeeze through. I just never thought to look in the cat section. And I like this model especially because of the all metal wire top, which provides the good ventilation that a rat needs and which cannot be chewed. There are also no exposed plastic edges that a rat could chew on. It is the perfect size for rats - large enough for a couple of rats for a short period of time but easy enough to carry around at a vet's office. The smallest babies may still need a smaller carrier until they are big enough not to squeeze through the door openings and if you are taking a long trip you may need a larger transport cage rather than a carrier, but for juvenile and adult rats and quick trips to the vet, this carrier is perfect. Rats and Do-It-Yourself projects go hand in hand. Many commercial rat toys/accessories are expensive, often unsafe for the animal they are intended for, often sized wrong, and tend not to last long. Ordinary household items/recyclables often work just as well or better with a little craftiness and a creative mind. There is now a Facebook group for sharing your own DIY projects, whether you just want to share what you've made or share tutorials showing how to make them: Crafty Rat Owners DIY Facebook Group. This is a great place to find new ideas for adorning your cage and for learning to make things you would have never thought of on your own. It is also a good community for sharing what you have done with other like-minded rat owners. The group includes everything from sewing projects, to crafts, woodworking, cage building - anything that you make yourself for the good of your ratties. Happy World Rat Day 2014! Pirate and Bela - He Loved His Girls! Bela and Ruby are Best Buds! Jo is Definitely Not Shy! I'm Pretty Sure I Smell Food!
A federal judge in California says that uninsulated power conductors owned by a local utility company were the cause of several wildfires that state agencies battled across California since 2017. U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup found that equipment from utility company Pacific Gas and Electric was the cause of some wildfires due to tree limbs and other debris knocking uninsulated power conductors together, NBC News reports. "The Court tentatively finds that the single most recurring cause of the large 2017 and 2018 wildfires attributable to PG&E’s equipment has been the susceptibility of PG&E’s distribution lines to trees or limbs falling onto them during high-wind events," Alsup's order reads, according to NBC. "The power conductors are almost always uninsulated. When the conductors are pushed together by falling trees or limbs, electrical sparks drop into the vegetation below. During the wildfire season when the vegetation is dry, these electrical sparks pose an extreme danger of igniting a wildfire," he added. Wildfires have damaged thousands of homes and killed dozens of people in the state over the past several years, including the massive Camp Fire that was contained by officials late last year after damaging 14,000 homes and killing 86 people. Pacific Gas and Electric told NBC in a statement that it was reviewing the judge's ruling and was committed to following "all rules and regulations that apply to our work." "PG&E’s most important responsibility is the safety of our customers and the communities we serve. We are aware of Judge Alsup’s latest order and are currently reviewing," PG&E said, according to NBC. "We are committed to complying with all rules and regulations that apply to our work, while working together with our state and community partners and across all sectors and disciplines to develop comprehensive, long-term safety solutions for the future."

Many of us are cautious about labels, me included. When people ask me what I believe regarding God, I say that I am a christian which leads to what denomination I am. I always find that one tough to answer. If I used a common denomination there would be less to say because most of us have a basic idea of what denominations believe outside of details. If I say I am a Christ follower (or worse, a follower of Paul) people just stare and say, yeah, we established that, but what denomination. Declaring yourself a non-denominational christian is basically declaring a denomination. At Dale Carnegie class we learned the 2 minute speech, which does work but when you throw in the that you believe God will save all men those 2 minutes are either going to be the end of a short conversation or the beginning of a long explanation! Nothing against Unitarians but that is very far from my beliefs, unfortunately, Unitarians seem to have the market covered regarding the term universalist. There are christian universalists, evangelical universalists, universal reconciliationist, believers in the greater hope, and no doubt more. Do we need another "ist" or "ism"? Probably not but I finally feel the need to label myself, I am an open universalist. I googled it and did not see this term, at least in the first few pages. I am not making an attempt to coin a new belief system, it is just a name that wraps up my beliefs in a simple way. Now if someone asks and they are interested I can explain why, if not, maybe they will google it and land here. The purpose of this site is to bring two wonderful theologies together using their unique perspectives and enlightening values. Please though, don't get hung up on the name!
When you live in a state like Florida, the threat of a pest infestation is as great as the likelihood of a severe summer storm. To ensure you protect your property and pockets from structural damage and financial loss, it's important to take preventative action against the Sunshine State's most destructive insects. At Busy Bee Termite & Pest Control, we specialize in not only eliminating pests but also helping homeowners prevent an infestation from happening. With that said, here are a few of the pests we receive the most calls about. Whether it's at the office, a store or in a hotel room, you can pick up a bed bug from almost anywhere. Once a bed bug catches a free ride into your home, it can become infested in no time. As with any other pest infestation, it's important to take back control of your property as soon as you notice the warning signs. Rodents like mice and rats love looking for a cozy place to call home when the temperature in northern Florida starts to dip. Aside from causing structural damage to your property, rodents can also pose numerous health risks, since many of them carry diseases like the Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome. If you notice any signs of a rodent infestation, it's important you contact pest control right away to avoid exposing yourself to a debilitating virus. Termites are responsible for about $30 billion in damage to crops and man-made structures in the United States every year. As a homeowner, if you notice a termite infestation, every minute counts when it comes to curbing the costs associated with repairs. When you factor in that most insurance companies don't cover damage stemming from a termite infestation, it's even more important to contact pest control immediately once you notice the signs. For more information about the residential and commercial pest control services we offer in Ponte Vedra, Florida, or if you're interested in receiving a free quote, contact Busy Bee Termite & Pest Control at 904-637-4608. Our team of pest control specialists looks forward to ridding your home of pests and helping you sleep more peacefully.
Bear hugs. Cinnamon rolls. Bridge. These were a few of the many things she did better than most people. But more than that, she was a person who took real joy in life, who gave more than she got, who put a premium on family and friends. One of those people of whom we think, if there were more people like her this world would be a better place. I did not spend nearly enough time with her, but I treasure every moment that I did.

A rectifier is an electrical device that converts alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC), a process known as rectification. Rectifiers have many uses including as components of power supplies and as amplitude modulation detectors (envelope detectors) of radio signals. Rectifiers are most commonly made using solid state diodes but other type of components can be used when very high voltages or currents are involved. When only a single diode is used to rectify AC (by blocking the negative or positive portion of the waveform), the difference between the term diode and the term rectifier is simply one of usage. The term rectifier describes a diode that is being used to convert AC to DC. Most rectifier circuits contain a number of diodes in a specific arrangement to more efficiently convert AC power to DC power than is possible with only a single diode. In half wave rectification, either the positive or negative half of the AC wave is passed, while the other half is blocked. Because only one half of the input waveform reaches the output, it is only 50% efficient if used for power transfer. Half-wave rectification can be achieved with a single diode in a single phase supply as shown in figure 6.1, or with three diodes in a three-phase supply. A full-wave rectifier converts both the positive and negative halves of the input waveform to a single polarity (positive or negative) at its output. By using both halves of the AC waveform full-wave rectification is more efficient than half wave. When a simple transformer with out a center tapped secondary is used, four diodes are required instead of the one needed for half-wave rectification. Four diodes arranged this way are called a diode bridge or bridge rectifier as shown in figure 6.2. The bridge rectifier can also be used for translating a DC input of unknown or arbitrary polarity into an output of known polarity. This is generally required in electronic telephones or other telephony devices where the DC polarity on the two phone wires is unknown. There are also applications for protecting against accidental battery reversal in battery-powered circuits. Figure 6.2 Bridge rectifier: a full-wave rectifier using 4 diodes. For single-phase AC, if the transformer is center-tapped, then two diodes back-to-back (i.e. anode-to-anode or cathode-to-cathode) can form a full-wave rectifier. Twice as many windings are required on the transformer secondary to obtain the same output voltage compared to the bridge rectifier above. This is not as efficient from the transformer perspective because current flows in only one half of the secondary during each positive and negative half cycle of the AC input. Figure 6.3 Full-wave rectifier using a center tapped transformer and 2 diodes. If a second pair of diodes is included as in figure 6.4 then both positive and negative polarity voltages with respect to the transformer center tap can be generated. One can also view this arrangement to be the same as adding a center tap to the secondary winding in the full-wave bridge rectifier from figure 6.2. Figure 6.4 Dual polarity Full-wave rectifier using a center tapped transformer and 4 diodes. Half-wave or full-wave rectification does not produce a constant-voltage DC as we have seen in the previous figures. In order to produce a steady DC voltage from a rectified AC source, a filter or smoothing circuit is needed. In the simplest form this can be just a capacitor placed across the DC output of the rectifier. There will still remain an amount of AC ripple voltage where the voltage is not completely smoothed. The amplitude of the remaining ripple depends on how much the load discharges the capacitor between the peaks of the waveform. Sizing of the filter capacitor, C1, represents a tradeoff. For a given load, RL, a larger capacitor will reduce ripple but will cost more and will create higher peak currents in the transformer secondary and in the supply feeding it. In extreme cases where many rectifiers are loaded onto a power distribution circuit, it may prove difficult for the power distribution grid to maintain a correctly shaped sinusoidal voltage waveform. A half-wave rectifier, figure 6.5(a) will only give one peak per cycle and for this and other reasons is only used in very small power supplies and where cost and complexity are of concern. A full wave rectifier, figure 6.5(b) achieves two peaks per cycle and this is the best that can be done with single-phase input. For three-phase inputs a three-phase bridge will give six peaks per cycle and even higher numbers of peaks can be achieved by using transformer networks placed before the rectifier to convert to a higher phase order. To further reduce this ripple, an LC π-filter (pi-filter) such as shown in figure 6.6 can be used. This complements the reservoir capacitor, C1, with a series inductor, L1, and a second filter capacitor, C2 so that a steadier DC output can be obtained across the terminals of the final filter capacitor. The series inductor presents a high impedance at the ripple current frequency. A more usual alternative to a filter, and essential if the DC load requires a very smooth supply voltage, is to follow the filter capacitor with a voltage regulator which we will discuss in section 6.3. The filter capacitor needs to be large enough to prevent the troughs of the ripple getting below the drop-out voltage of the regulator being used. The regulator serves both to remove the last of the ripple and to deal with variations in supply and load characteristics. It would be possible to use a smaller filter capacitor (which can be large for high-current power supplies) and then apply some filtering as well as the regulator, but this is not a common design strategy. The extreme of this approach is to dispense with the filter capacitor altogether and put the rectified waveform straight into an inductor input filter. The advantage of this circuit is that the current waveform is smoother and consequently the rectifier no longer has to deal with the current as a large current pulse just at the peaks of the input sine wave, but instead the current delivery is spread over more of the cycle. The downside is that the voltage output is much lower - approximately the average of an AC half-cycle rather than the peak. The simple half wave rectifier can be built in two versions with the diode pointing in opposite directions, one version connects the negative terminal of the output direct to the AC supply and the other connects the positive terminal of the output direct to the AC supply. By combining both of these with separate output smoothing capacitors it is possible to get an output voltage of nearly double the peak AC input voltage, figure 6.7. This also provides a tap in the middle, which allows use of such a circuit as a split rail (positive and negative) supply. Figure 6.7 Simple voltage doubler. A variant of this is to use two capacitors in series for the output smoothing on a bridge rectifier then place a switch between the midpoint of those capacitors and one of the AC input terminals. With the switch open this circuit will act like a normal bridge rectifier with it closed it will act like a voltage doubling rectifier. In other words this makes it easy to derive a voltage of roughly 320V (+/- around 15%) DC from any mains supply in the world, this can then be fed into a relatively simple switched mode power supply. Capacitors are used to smooth out or filter the ripple present in the rectified DC, and sometimes more complex filters using inductors as well as capacitors are used. Zener diodes are widely used as voltage references and as shunt regulators to regulate the voltage across small circuits. When connected in parallel with a varying voltage source, such as the diode rectifier we just discussed, so that it is reverse biased, the zener diode conducts when the voltage reaches the diode's reverse breakdown voltage. From that point on, the relatively low impedance of the diode keeps the voltage across the diode at that value. In the circuit shown in figure 6.8, a typical shunt regulator, an input voltage, VIN, is regulated down to a stable output voltage VOUT. The reverse bias breakdown voltage of diode DZ is stable over a wide current range and holds VOUT relatively constant even though the input voltage may fluctuate over a fairly wide range. Because of the low impedance of the diode when operated like this, series resistor RS is used to limit current through the circuit. In the case of this simple reference, the current flowing in the diode is determined using Ohm's law and the known voltage drop across the resistor RS. RS must be small enough that the current through DZ keeps DZ in reverse breakdown. The value

In a case of first impression in the Commonwealth, the Supreme Court of Virginia recently considered whether an attorney may be liable for drafting a will which results in the failure of a testamentary gift to intended beneficiaries. Historically, will beneficiaries had been denied a means of recovery against attorneys due to a lack of privity between the parties. Although Virginia remains a "strict privity' jurisdiction, it recognizes third-party contract beneficiary claims' and has legislatively abrogated the privity requirement in other areas of the law. The plaintiffs in Copenhaver v. Rogers sought to establish a third-party beneficiary claim as the intended beneficiaries of the contract between the deceased testator-client and the drafting attorney. The court implicitly recognized the potential viability of such a claim, yet concluded that the requisite cause of action had not been stated. The court further surmised that under current Virginia law it would "no doubt be difficult for a litigant, in the case of this kind, to meet the requirements of third-party beneficiary claims."

With 20,000+ new apps hitting the market every month, making yours stand out from the crowd and get noticed is crucial to it’s success. Publicity can be difficult to attain at the best of times – most journalists (including bloggers) receive large volumes of press releases each week. How can you make sure yours cuts through the clutter and gets noticed – and published? Press release and press kit are two fundamental pieces of your mobile app or game discovery in the jungle of bloggers, journalists and reviewers. Every single day, they are literally getting spammed by hundreds of demands to write about new apps and games. Most of these requests are too long, boring, formally wrong and have no added value. So question is – how do you distinguish yourself? Well, just by writing a professional-looking press release and wrapping it into a decent press kit, your chances to be noticed are much higher. For more tips about mobile app marketing, click here. Unless you are a native english speaker with extraordinary writing skills, don’t even try to write your own press release. You can hire decent and cheap copywriters on sites like Odesk or Freelancer or you can even try TouchArcade forums where is a special section for game developer services and trades. Maybe you can barter some good deal out there! Headline is the first thing your potential publisher will read. Build a curiosity, catch attention and point out the biggest benefit of your app. No – your app or game title is not a striking headline. Place your shiny well-designed icon just around the headline. Your press release should be written as a final news story. You need to include every important detail in this part – who are you, what is point of your app, when you are going to release it. At first, don’t forget to write a short summary tagline and put it just below the headline. Then you are supposed to include a short introduction – one or two sentences about a developer and previous titles, then another one or two about a goal of your app. Don’t explain every feature of your game here. The next paragraph should be a full description of your app. Explain how it works, what is the added value. Why should people play your game? What is the main mechanic and how many levels or challenges can player enjoy? Is it a freemium or premium title? What platforms will it support? When you are going to release your title? You can add a short quote about your product from a well-known influencer (if you have one). You can put in one or two screenshots, however if you are sending a whole press kit, it’s better to attach high-quality screenshots, artworks and icons in it. Just state the facts in bullets – URL of your game microsite with press kit, company website, contact email. You can also include your Skype name, Twitter profile or Facebook page. But stick only to relevant information. Send it! Check out this list of mobile game review websites and choose relevant contacts. Dont forget to include your press release in a complex press kit. Then upload your whole press kit to your website and provide additional information to interested journalist. Share it on social media channels or forums, but don’t spam!

As a Recruiter specializing in offering job opportunities in Sales, I am fortunate enough to get to speak with lots of great candidates and clients on a daily basis from junior level Telesales reps to Country Managers in SME’s and multinational companies. The one thing I notice they all have in common is they all have an intrinsic desire to help others and build relationships. This got me thinking a lot about my own motivations and why one might choose a career in sales. Why choose a job in Sales? Working in a Sales job gives you a sense of accomplishment - Closing a sale is not just a matter of promoting something and getting payment. Many sales people really get a feeling of accomplishment after they close a sale because they know that it was they who made the sale happen! Become a Rock Star in your Field! In sales, we don’t measure our success in dollars per hour. Many sales positions don’t pay a salary or an hourly wage. Commissions can be scary, but in an hourly position, you can get fired for not doing your job. In an hourly position, your hours can be cut or increased based on your performance. If you’re doing really well, you are rewarded with a raise or a bonus. The difference is, when working on commission, you have complete control. The average Sales Director can earn up to €130k yearly, while a Junior telesales rep has an earning potential of €40k. Not bad for an entry level role!! Pursuing a job in Sales you deal with customers. It’s about serving others and adding value to their lives. This creates long lasting success in any profession. IT sales is the area that continues to grow as more and more companies enter the Irish market looking to hire “inside sales” people. Typically, they are technology or software companies targeting UK and European clients and in a lot of cases desire languages and qualifications. Sales jobs on the FMCG side has seen a small growth at mid-tier level such as key accounts and territory sales. This is expected to continue and potentially create demand for junior sales roles as a result of them. Other areas that are expected to grow are technical jobs such as sales engineers and technical sales consultants in engineering and construction for experienced people. There was some growth in 2015 and in the early part of 2016 another surge is expected. My own job is sales and I have to say I love it. I take great pleasure in finding people their ideal job opportunity in Sales. If a sales job is what you’re looking for then let me help.
Vancouver, British Columbia, May 18, 2017 – Prophecy Development Corp. (“Prophecy” or the “Company”) (TSX:PCY, OTCPK:PRPCF, Frankfurt:1P2N) is pleased to announce that it has finalized detailed internal mine plans for the Paca project, initially targeting nearsurface mineralization with a low mining strip ratio. In addition, the Company has executed agreements regarding the sourcing of skilled workers through the local Pulacayo cooperatives for future mining operations at the Pulacayo and Paca projects. Further to the Company’s news release dated December 2, 2016, Prophecy has renewed the letter of intent (LOI) to lease mining equipment from Oroscons S.R.L. Under the updated LOI which expires June 30, 2017, Oroscons agrees to provide Prophecy through lease, a mining and transportation fleet that would enable open-pit mining of the Paca deposit at a minimum rate of 200 tonnes of ore per day. Further to the Company’s news release dated December 14, 2016, Prophecy is negotiating with a number of vendors that provide dedicated toll milling services at their ore processing facilities located in Potosi, which is a 2.5 hour drive by car, on paved road from Pulacayo. The toll milling services would entail the processing of mined materials to be supplied by the Company, utilizing conventional crushing, grinding and flotation technology to produce zinc-silver and lead-silver concentrates. Given the low rates of capacity utilization of a great number of ore processing facilities (>50) in Potosi, the Company is confident it can finalize a new toll milling agreement at lower cost than the one signed last December. Prophecy continues discussions with a number of large trading and smelting companies that are interested in purchasing future zinc-silver and lead-silver concentrates processed from Pulacayo and Paca mined materials and providing Prophecy with advance payment against future concentrate delivery to finance Paca to production. The most recent trial test runs at two concentrate-buyer designated processing facilities demonstrated high rates of silver recoveries (>85%) from Paca bulk sampling. Prophecy is further encouraged by an improved concentrate purchase term-sheet received from a major trader in May with significantly lower processing charges, consistent with industry trends. Please refer to the Company’s June 18, 2015 and September 21, 2015 news releases for details regarding the amount and grade of resources for the Pulacayo and Paca deposits. Lastly, the Company’s Bolivian subsidiary, ASC Bolivia LDC Sucursal Bolivia, has invested approximately US$28 million at Pulacayo and already acquired necessary environmental and social licenses to mine at Pulacayo. The Company is working with the Bolivian mining ministry and Corporacion Minera De Bolivia (COMIBOL) (which is under internal restructuring with a newly-appointed COMIBOL President) to obtain authorization for mining. The Company is confident that all key pre-requisites (community and ministerial support, mining equipment, mine plan, toll milling, concentrate off take and project financing through advance concentrate sales payments) are or will be in place for rapid mobilization to bring Paca and Pulacayo to production as soon as authorization is obtained. In March, Prophecy partially sponsored a Bolivian delegation headed by the Bolivian Minister of Mining and Metallurgy to attend the Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) mining conference in Toronto, Canada. The event successfully brought new Canadian investors to Bolivia. The Company will provide further update on project progress in due course. A positive production decision would not be based on a feasibility study of mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability so would carry increased uncertainty and the risk of failure as to the mining method and profitability. The technical content of this news release was reviewed and approved by Christopher M. Kravits, CPG, LPG, who is a Qualified Person within the meaning of NI 43-101. Mr. Kravits is a consultant to the Company and serves as its Qualified Person and General Mining Manager. Mr. Kravits is not independent of the Company since most of his income is derived from the Company.
Use fertilizer and mulch to supply the nutrients essential for a productive garden and maintain moist and cool soil. Fertilizer is one way to supply the nutrients essential for a productive garden. The key is to use the right kind and apply it in moderation. The most common fertilizers are made from salts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, nutrients used by plants in the largest quantity. You’ll see them labeled as N-P-K: 5-10-10, 20-20-20, or similar. The three numbers are the percentages of those three nutrients in the product. Because they are salts, too much can kill your plants. Use the product in the amount recommended on the label to help your plants flourish. Overfertilizing can also delay harvest. Plants that must bloom in order to produce their fruit (tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, squash, cucumbers, melons, beans, peas, and okra) need a balanced approach to nutrition. If they get too much nitrogen, they’ll grow a lot of foliage and flowering will be delayed. Usually a dilute liquid fertilizer is used when transplants are set in the soil, followed in a week or two by granular fertilizer or timed-release granules applied at the rate recommended on the product label. Reapply as recommended, as different products remain active in the garden for varying lengths of time. Organic gardeners use compost and other amendments, such as kelp, fish emulsion, cottonseed, and soybean meal to enrich the soil and feed the worms and soil microbes. This plant-feeding system works quite well, and it has long-term benefits. Mulch is organic material that hasn’t yet decomposed. It reduces evaporation, which keeps soil moist and cool. It also prevents weeds. Common choices include pine needles, tree bark from various species, wheat straw, and even newspaper and pasteboard boxes. If papers are used, be sure to cover them with another mulch or they’ll blow about on windy days. Areas covered with four to five sheets of newsprint or flattened boxes are certain to be weed-free. Avoid rubber mulches that don’t break down; you want mulch to decay and enrich the soil.

South Dakota State University is classified as a doctoral-granting university with high research activity. This very large four-year institution has an estimated annual full-time enrollment of 3,000 to 9,999 students. Approximately half of degree-seeking students are enrolled full time, and 25% to 49% of undergraduates reside on campus. This institution awards 60-79% of its bachelor’s degrees within professional fields. Graduate degrees are available in up to half of the fields available to undergraduate majors, and the school awards research doctorate degrees in a variety of fields. Most of these graduate degrees are awarded in professional fields other than engineering, such as education, health professions, social work, or public policy. According to data for fall enrollment, at least 80% of undergraduates are enrolled full-time. Transfer students make up at least 20% of entering undergraduates. Enrollment data shows that both graduates and undergraduates are enrolled at this institution. Over 90% of the student body are enrolled as undergraduates.
On 30.03.2017, Asst. Prof. Beni Cukurel was awarded “Henri Gutwirth Prize for Promotion of Excellence in Research” on his research associated with “Acoustic Resonance Enhanced Heat Exchangers”. In the modern technological world, many systems require heat to be either added or dissipated towards maintaining their operability and enhancing their thermodynamic efficiency. This change in gas/liquid temperature is typically provided by a heat exchanger (HE), which operates by associating two streams of different thermal potential. Due to form factor limitations of many size restrained applications, the state of the art is advancing towards more compact designs. This forms the basis towards higher performance and efficiency HEs – enabling more heat transfer for the same size heat exchanger unit. This can be achieved by means of designs having sets of perturbators (ribs, pins, fins etc.) in the heat exchange passageways, providing larger heat transfer surface area per unit of volume and promoting turbulence in the flow. This yields higher thermal efficiency at the expense of additional pressure penalty. Prof. Cukurel’s project is complementary to current existing HE designs, as he seeks to further increase the thermal efficiency of existing HE units without significant geometric modifications. In the scope of his work, the heat transfer in an existing unit is augmented using a standing acoustic wave. Preliminary research has achieved significant heat transfer enhancement (up to 25%) without inducing additional pressure drop.

In 2019, Middlebury is undergoing its comprehensive evaluation for reaccreditation by New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE). Jeff Cason, Provost and LeRoy Graham, Associate Provost for Planning are co-chairing the Reaccreditation Steering Committee that is overseeing this process. Middlebury’s last comprehensive evaluation was in 2011, followed by an interim report in 2015. There are several components to this evaluation that are outlined below. The self-study is a 100-page document that covers the standards for accreditation as defined by NECHE. The document is being drafted with input from individuals and groups from across the institution. It is currently available for review by the Middlebury community. After review by the community it will be revised, formatted, and forwarded to NECHE and the accreditation visiting team. NECHE appoints a review team made up of 8-9 professionals from colleges and universities who have a broad range of knowledge and expertise. This team is responsible for carrying out the review and writing a report that is submitted to NECHE. Dr. Ronald Crutcher, President of the University of Richmond, has been appointed the chair of Middlebury’s review team. The entire review team will be announced later in 2019. The full Review Team will visit Middlebury Vermont from November 3 - 6 for a series of meetings with staff, faculty, and students. Representatives from the team are also expected to visit the Language Schools, the Bread Loaf School of English, one of the Schools Abroad, as well as the Middlebury Institute ahead of the November meeting in Vermont. President Patton informed the Middlebury Community of the comprehensive evaluation in 2018. Many individuals have been involved with developing content for the self-study throughout 2018-2019. Open meetings have been scheduled while the self-study is available for comment. Open meetings for faculty, staff, and students will also be held during site visits.

Saving energy is good for our planet and good for our wallet. So how can you become more energy efficient at home? You can start by monitoring your energy use at home. Did you know that heating and cooling account for nearly half of your home’s energy costs? It’s true. And if you can cut the cost of heating and cooling your home, you’ll make a big difference in your bottom line. Here are a few things that you can do to help you save energy. A dirty or clogged filter will make your air conditioning unit work harder, using more energy. Over time, the stress of clogged filters can result in increased costs for repair or replacement of your HVAC unit. Dust, mold and other contaminants can build up in your air ducts, making the system work harder (and lowering the air quality in your home). Have your ducts cleaned annually to keep your HVAC unit running in peak condition. A programmable or smart thermostat can save you up to 10 percent on heating and cooling costs. If your home has single-pane windows, consider replacing them with more energy efficient windows. Also, think about adding solar shades or tinting film. Call the experts at ASAP Heating an Cooling for more information or to schedule an appointment. ASAP Heating and Cooling provides quality heating and cooling services to homes and businesses in Port Charlotte, Cape Coral, Naples, Southwest Florida and surrounding service areas. Do you have a smart thermostat? If not, this is something you should definitely consider. Heating and cooling account for nearly half of your home’s energy costs. Smart thermostats are the next generation of temperature control. They offer automation and more control over your home’s temperature and climate, which can save you money on your energy bill. Your smart thermostat’s Wi-Fi connection enables so much more than just temperature automation. Here are some of the advantages to owning a smart thermostat. A smart thermostat makes it easy to be energy efficient. Smart thermostats learn your schedule and your preferences, so they can handle the dropping and raising of your home’s temperature while you come and go. Your smart thermostat can also save you money by making you more energy efficient. Letting your smart thermostat manage your home’s climate automatically will push you toward energy-saving settings and help save you money. With some smart thermostats, you can get a monthly report that can help you to analyze your energy use. The report can tell you how much energy you used that month. It can compare your usage to that of other users and reward you for using energy-efficient settings. When you’re away from home, your smart thermostat can help keep you connected. Check the companion app while you’re away from home to see if the air conditioner is running and to check the temperature in your home. It’s a great way to make sure that your home is running smoothly while you’re away. With a smart thermostat, you can adjust the temperature in your home from anywhere. If you’ve got a mobile device, you’ve got control of your home thermostat. Some smart thermostats will even send email alerts if your home’s temperature rises or falls outside of your pre-determined range. It can also notify you if your thermostat is disconnected from its network, which can happen during a power outage. Smart thermostats are also great for vacations. They make it easy to set the temperature while you’re away without messing up your existing settings. Most smart thermostats are very easy to use. They have modern screen designs and great companion apps. If you’ve had issues dealing with programmable thermostats in the past, you’ll appreciate this new generation’s easy-to-use design. No matter what kind of thermostat you have, keep your air conditioning unit running in tip-top condition. Call the experts at ASAP Heating and Cooling to schedule an appointment. ASAP Heating and Cooling provides quality heating and cooling services to homes and businesses in Port Charlotte, Cape Coral, Naples, Southwest Florida and surrounding service areas. What constitutes an HVAC emergency? If you experience an HVAC system that fails to cool or heat, you’ve got an HVAC emergency on your hands, especially in unusually hot or cold temperatures. You may notice unwanted sounds or strange odors. This is also a problem that should be addressed immediately. Unfortunately, HVAC problems can occur at all hours of the day or night. When your air conditioning system breaks or malfunctions, you should know what to do to ensure the well being of yourself and your family. Here are some tips to follow when you need emergency HVAC repair. Before calling for a professional service company, it’s best to understand the problem. Check for any small problems you can fix on your own. If troubleshooting has not fixed the problem, it’s time to call in the professionals. Do not attempt to fix your HVAC unit by yourself. Trying to fix the problem yourself can lead to much bigger problems – and what begins as a small repair bill can turn into a much higher cost. If it is extremely hot or cold outside, you will want to fix the problem as soon as possible. Call for a professional HVAC technician – and if it’s after hours, make sure they have 24/7 emergency service. While you wait for the technician to arrive, make yourself as comfortable as possible. In hot weather, use fans to help cool the area and wear light clothing. In cold weather, use layering to keep heat in and use blankets to stay warm. If available, a space heater will help to keep a small area warm. At ASAP Heating and Cooling, we are happy to provide emergency services 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If you’ve got an HVAC emergency, our helpful technicians will have your system up and running again in no time. The air conditioning coils are one of the most critical components of your air conditioning system. These AC coils are very delicate, and they need to be properly handled to preserve their cooling power. With regular maintenance, well-preserved AC coils will help keep indoor air quality higher and utility bills lower. Your air conditioning system has two sets of coils – evaporator coils and condenser coils. The evaporator coils are located on the indoor portion of your AC system. They are responsible for absorbing heat from your home’s air and transferring it to the refrigerant that carries it out of your home. The condenser coils are located in the outdoor portion of your air conditioning system. They are responsible for transferring heat from the refrigerant to the air outside your home or building. Over time, both your evaporator coils and your condenser coils can suffer from dirt buildup, which can have a big impact on the performance and efficiency of your air conditioner. With dirt buildup on the coils, it is harder for the system to transfer and absorb heat. So your air conditioner will have to work harder, and it will have to run more often, which means it will use a lot more energy to keep your home cool. Here’s what you should know about air conditioner coil cleaning. Much of your air conditioner’s coils are tucked away inside the system, making it difficult to effectively clean them on your own. Also, the coil fins are delicate and extremely sensitive. Improper handling could potentially lead to a very costly repair. That’s why it’s best to have a professional air conditioning company do the job. At ASAP Heating and Cooling, we’ll give you a free estimate for your system. Two primary benefits of a proper AC coil cleaning are an increased system efficiency and cooling power, plus improved indoor air quality. This maintenance should be done annually, before summer. Call the experts at ASAP Heating and Cooling for more information or to schedule an appointment for coil cleaning. ASAP Heating and Cooling provides quality heating and cooling services to homes and businesses in Port Charlotte, Cape Coral, Naples, Southwest Florida and surrounding service areas. Did you know that you can reduce your HVAC system use by as much as ten percent by raising or lowering your thermostat? In the summer months, the U.S. Department of Energy recommends keeping your home’s temperature at 78 degrees. Another good way to keep your HVAC usage in check is to maintain the system. A well maintained AC unit will run more efficiently, use less energy and cost less money to run. A properly maintained system will also last longer before needing to be replaced. Your air conditioner’s filters, coils and fins require regular maintenance to keep your AC unit functioning effectively and efficiently throughout its years of service. If you neglect necessary maintenance, you will have a steady decline in air conditioning performance – and your energy usage will steadily increase. Here are 5 ways to help maintain your air conditioner. This is your most important maintenance task
“We’ve had twice the opportunity to enjoy Aline’s exceptional work. Once in our home in Paris, during a session with our 8 years old daughter and again while our family visited Prague. Thanks to Aline’s albums, we now have unique and truly priceless memories of these events. Beyond the quality of the photographs and Aline’s sense of details, we appreciated her ability to put us at ease and forget the lens in front of us. We always felt very comfortable and it is probably this complicity that is reflected in all our portraits. But another of Aline’s strengths is her incredible sense of design and her love for publishing and artistic direction. Not only do we have beautiful pictures, but the albums Aline created for us don’t look like any other. They are unique, as pleasing to the eye as they are to the touch, looking perfect in our library. They were custom made, just for us. The details are delicate, the finishes impeccable. It is a work of haute couture, which one never tires of. An album by Aline is not a photo album, it’s a family heirloom, a art book of our memories that we never tire of watching and sharing. “Our experience with Junko d. Photography was amazing! Aline has a unique ability to capture those candid, natural moments and most importantly… she connected with our family. Working with you was a fantastic experience. Your calm, professional attitude, the preparation and the incredible attention to every detail made this experience extremely memorable. You worked to understand the subject of the pictures, you spent countless hours preparing the set to create the best possible photographs. All of this preparation and your professional skills were clearly represented in the photographs. “Our family had the wonderful pleasure of working with Aline twice. First, for a family photo shoot with our toddler in Prague (while I was 8 months pregnant) and again a couple months later for our daughter’s newborn photo shoot. Aline made us feel comfortable, was aware and considerate to our given situations (pregnant and dealing with a toddler, and later postpartum with a toddler and a newborn), and made sure to deliver on all her promises of beautiful photography that captured our family in our natural dynamic. We felt a true connection with her and were not only pleased with her ability to connect with us as a couple, but also our kids. She was patient, kind, and has a natural ability for working with both older children and babies. Equally impressive are the products she offers. We ordered canvas prints, a studio album, a coffee table book, as well as just digital negatives for our own use. Hers are premium quality products that surpass that which you will find elsewhere or be able to easily produce yourself. You can rest assured that you are paying for the highest level of professional quality. Aline, your work is true art! “As we are leaving Prague after seven years, we wanted to keep special memories of this great city where we had our two children. “Being a photographer myself, I asked Junko d. Photography to create portraits of my 7 years old daughter. I was very happy with the pictures which reflect childhood tenderness without being soppy. They are fresh and capture what my daughter really is today.

tongue ties relax with time. Intresting question.In fact I have been under quite pressure to do this procedure by my referring colleuges and parents of patient.I do about 5/10 patient including adult in a year but refuse to do in as many as 100 patients. They all come with a belief that this is some thing which will make the child start speaking immediately. tongue tie realease is less understood in this part of world.the tie should be released after the age of four years since the rease may occure by it self when child grows and use the tongue for speech. the evaluation should be done carefuly since it may not be the cause of the problem.

Will the content on Mocavo still be free when it is available on Findmypast? Once we have migrated all of the data from Mocavo to Findmypast, the data which was previously freely available, will remain so for the foreseeable future.
The last 20 weeks have been a whirlwind. A whirlwind of changes, of immigration paperwork, of realising just how little i understand about being a military spouse. This time last November, RM had just proposed and we were figuring out wedding plans and all of the permissions needed for us to make our late January wedding date work. But work it did and it was beautiful. It required permission from different parts of the AirForce in different parts of the world. It was quite the introduction to life as a military spouse. Life took on a new cast very quickly. The next couple of months were full with both of us very busy with work and with plans to ship all my household goods in two separate shipments in advance of setting out on the Overland from Oz adventure. There was purging and packing, and saying goodbye. Then life threw us a curveball with me being able to travel to spend a little time with with RM in New Mexico after a two month separation instead of completing my Overland from Oz trip straight away. In the midst of this unexpected time together we were also able to put together the remaining aspects of our immigration paperwork packet. I was able to complete to complex medical examinations — including a chest xray to show I don’t have tuberculosis and enough blood draws and vaccinations to make my arms really sore for days – and for us to compile almost 200 pages of documentation and evidence that we have a bonafide marriage relationship. The medical examination process was quite the adventure — and not for the faint of heart. In as remote an area as we are located there is only one civil surgeon and so unless you want to drive for 90 minutes to find an alternative then you go where you are told. The doctor’s office administrative staff seemed confused about the availability of appointments and the cost. The cost for completion of the report was $450. This is an expensive process! The doctor’s office was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. To say it was run down might not quite get at it. The skirting boards and door jams were missing, there were stained ceiling tiles, the floor was covered in dust (although to be frank that’s pretty usual around here), the upholstery on the patient’s examining tables were ripped, the cabinets in the consulting rooms were broken. It made for quite the contrast to the Medical Clinic on base where I had to have blood drawn, immunizations done, and a chest xray done. The military medical corps were professional, efficient, and focused on the big picture! Having to have another Tuberculosis test was always going to be a frustrating experience! Even though I have records stating that I’ve had a TB vaccination, I was still tested by the civil surgeon, which was going to result in an inevitable reaction. Hopefully, I will never have to have that test again! So too, the civil surgeon had a strange request at one point — he wanted a note from my mother that I had indeed had Chicken Pox. I think I managed to convince him that I had had the chicken pox when I was a kid! I was quite the pin cushion that week…i think it was a total of 8 needles in four days. I don’t even mind needles, but this wasn’t much fun. In the end, I had to return to the doctor’s office three times before the forms were completed. But this change of plans caused us to field another curve. Right now, until we receive a decision, I am not able to leave the country without it effectively cancelling our application (unless I apply for a parole document which still doesn’t guarantee that I would be able to enter the US after leaving while we have an immigration application pending). Thus, our four month old marriage needs a lot of documentation so that I will hopefully receive my conditional permanent residency and be able to travel freely to see my family. Yep, this immigration paperwork thing is not for the faint of heart! In addition to all the forms and the money that is required to file each form, there is so much documentation that has to accompany each of the forms — as well as at least half a dozen passport photos! The forms cost approximately $1500 to file including the biometric fees. So, in total, with the fee for medical examination and the fees for different records, like police checks, it was just over $2000 US Dollars to file! It was time to write about all of this because our immigration packet has been received and is undergoing initial review. While I lived in the USA for graduate school back until 2009, when I moved to Scotland, this is completely different. This is for keeps! This isn’t a visa enabling me to study, this is the immigration process to enable our family to live together! I’ve had to grapple with what may eventually mean citizenship. The whole “Your people will be my people” part of the Book of Ruth is becoming a whole lot more real! We figure that it is likely that there will be Air Force mandated separations, and as much as I have so many adventures ahead of me, just as we do together, I’m really glad that we are now on the road to being able to be together when we can. We’ve had a few people ask about whether or not being active duty military can make this process quicker. In short, the answer is no. Simply being active duty is no longer enough for approval of expedited processing. If you have evidence of an upcoming deployment it can be awarded but that isn’t even a guarantee. In short, I’d rather not have my husband deploy again, just to make my status here in the US clearer, quicker. Until the end of the July my current visa is valid, but since the USCIS has accepted our application and is in the process of making a decision, I am now in limbo — I’m awaiting the processing of my permanent visa, but I am unable to seek out employment, sort out a driver’s license, sort out banking, and change my name formally with the Social security administration. In the meantime, I’m the one over here making lavender infused gin and vermouth de provence so that they can steep until RM’s birthday next month and reviewing the lovely invitations i’ve had designed. Until i get authorisation to work in the US, i’m a lady who lunches, plans parties, bakes and gets dinner on the table every day. If i wasn’t also writing and exploring the neighbourhood with my camera I’m not sure i’d recognise myself in the mirror. Gluten Free Coconut Cream Pie and fresh Strawberries!

This is week 9 of the Kansas City Contemporary Home Renovation Series. Just in case you missed it, here’s Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, Week 5, Week 6, Week 7, and Week 8. The time has finally come, the reveal of our Kansas City Contemporary Home Renovation! The original kitchen was much darker with only one window letting in natural light. And while it had ample space it didn’t take advantage of the height of the kitchen. The project also re-located the laundry room, powder bathroom and updated the entryway, dining room and family room. The transformation is amazing and hardly recognizable. The new kitchen has tons of natural light coming in from the windows and skylights. The new cabinets take full advantage of the height in the kitchen. Removing the dining area in the kitchen allowed for more cabinet space as well as room for the new live edge table. The live edge wood pieces are beautiful focal points. The fireplace bricks and the bar area were removed. Art shelves were created in the former bar area. The fireplace looks stunning with the new tile and the open art shelves make the room feel more open. The former laundry room is now a beautiful new prep kitchen. The prep kitchen has storage for small appliances, a sink, and refrigerator drawers making it the perfect place to juice fresh fruits and vegetables every day. A powder bathroom was added off of the family room a much more convenient spot when entertaining. The live edge vanity and light fixture add awesome drama to the small room.

God has no gray, and He recognizes no fence. This is no small thing to reckon with, especially since we are so often creatures of compromise. God is absolute, and to fail to say yes to Him, is to say no. Everything is at stake in how we choose – our children, our spouses, our families, and our own lives. Have we truly seen that His ways are not our ways? It’s our way or God’s way, and we’ll have to leave our ways for His. "If you want human praise, you can have it in this life. But you will not have the praise of God." In June's Message of the Month, Martha Kilpatrick quietly and lovingly reveals the peril in believing that we can follow God while reserving the right to do what we want. If the world is our source, then God will not be – we cannot have it both ways. "So then, because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of My mouth" (Rev. 3:16). As chaos, crisis and war increase all around us, we have never been more in need of a Good Shepherd. We're tempted to look at what it costs us to follow God unreservedly, but here Martha clearly reminds us of all we're given by our Father, all that He does for us, and the unbearable loss of the eternal Light Himself that we risk. God’s ways are not our ways, and He is absolute.

Three of us were laid off this pas week. Same company...different locations. All 3 of us are the most tenured employees in our location. We have the highest pay with the most vacation. We are ages 55, 57 and 60. Is this disparate impact?
Quality is pretty horrible. Sounds like 96 kbps MP3 with random audio issues and then recompressed. Probably it is due to "master tempo" usage.
This is a beautifully laid tarmac that stretches over a distance of 151 miles. It is arguably the most picturesque drive in the world – and definitely the best in Australia. You can hire a car in Melbourne and let yourself loose to enjoy the breathtaking sights, like the incredible rock formation of the Twelve Apostles. There’s also the Angelsea Golf Course, surf spots at Torquay, many kangaroos, and much more. All these spectacular sights await you on your trip along the Great Ocean Road. This could be the most thrilling adventure you’ll experience in Australia. Starting from Port Douglas, you can take a crocodile cruise along the Daintree River, watching these fearsome, humongous creatures brooding along the river banks and basking in the sunshine. However, the main treat is when guides throw meat in their direction to entice them out of the water. You’ll then watch the crocs in all their glory, jumping out of the the water to clasp their jaws around the food. Even if you’ve had your fair share of surfing during your time in the US, surfing in Australia is a whole new experience. Here, you’ll be shown the different surfing etiquettes, techniques and also get to learn about the various surf boards that are popularly used. After your first couple of efforts, you’ll be shown pictures of you surfing to demonstrate how you can improve next time around. The experience is both exciting and educative at the same time. More importantly, surfing in Australia is competitive, so you’ll get to learn from the best of the best. 155 miles north of Perth is The Pinnacle Desert, which is home of hundreds of ancient limestone pillars that resemble tombs. It is a mysterious setting and part of the Nambung National Park, bordering the village of Cervantes in Western Australia. It’s said that the limestones were formed over 30,000 years ago after the Indian Ocean coastal waves eroded the surrounding area, thereby exposing what is now The Pinnacle Desert. The impressive landscape is excellent for taking pictures and spending quality time with family. Australia has something remarkable for everyone, and if you love adventure, then your prospective move to this country will prove to be a great decision.

Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, are a way for investors to help manage the risks of inflation. TIPS’ principal adjusts upward along with consumer price inflation, or CPI, which provides investors with a guaranteed “real return” (or return after inflation). Individual TIPS bonds can be an important portfolio component for investors who want to maintain the purchasing power of their savings. But TIPS, despite being issued by the U.S. government, are not free of ​risk – particularly if you choose to access the asset class through mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Since TIPS are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, they are seen as being free of credit risk. In other words, investors are guaranteed to receive all of the interest and principal that’s coming to them. While the price of a TIPS bond will fluctuate between the time when it is issued and the date at which it matures, a person who holds until maturity isn’t affected by these price movements. However, this moderate level of volatility does have the potential to become an issue if a person sells a bond prior to its maturity date. In this case, he or she isn’t guaranteed to receive the bond’s par value since its market price could be more or less than par at the time of the sale. Another potential risk of TIPS is that the official CPI fails to track actual inflation or the rising prices of the products or services the investor needs. In this case, there is the chance that the element of inflation protection in the bonds will be insufficient to protect that investor’s true purchasing power. A third risk is the rare chance of deflation or falling prices. In this case, investors would likely sell TIPS – driving prices down – since there would be no need for inflation protection. This indeed occurred during the depths of the financial crisis of 2008, when fears of a worldwide financial meltdown raised the possibility of deflation and led to a sharp decline in the prices of TIPS in the autumn of that year. Deflation a long-shot possibility, but one that merits consideration. While TIPS will work as intended for investors who buy individual bonds and hold them to maturity, those who hold TIPS via mutual funds or ETFs face an entirely different set of risks. Funds do provide an element of inflation protection in the sense that the principal value of the bonds held by the funds will indeed adjust upward with inflation. However, unlike individual securities, bond funds have no maturity date. This means that investors are not guaranteed to see a full return of principal. And since TIPS are highly sensitive to interest rate movements, the value of a TIPS mutual fund or ETF can fluctuate widely in a very short period. These losses are meaningful since inflation typically has run in the 1-3% range in recent years. As a result, it doesn't take much of a loss to offset the protection feature in the funds’ TIPS holdings. TIPS funds face another headwind: higher inflation generally leads to higher rates, which equates to falling share prices for TIPS mutual funds and ETFs. Any hint that inflation is rising would almost certainly lead to a decline in Treasury prices (keep in mind, prices and yields move in opposite directions), which in turn would weigh heavily on the prices of TIPS and the funds that invest in them. In this sense, TIPS funds actually provide the opposite of what many investors may be expecting: rather protecting against inflation, they will-in-fact be affected by it. For short-dated TIPS funds, the impact would be less severe. Keep in mind, this is only a problem if rates rise. But with yields already at extremely low levels, investors in TIPS funds are taking a chance that their investment won’t live up to expectations.
The founding idea that Instant Access Technologies (IAT) had for epoints was simple – to build an online loyalty system with enough redeemable rewards to satisfy anyone. (English) With nearly 2000 online stores and partners, 2 million rewards, and a variety of innovative and interactive ways for users to raise their score, epoints has become one of the most powerful online loyalty platforms around. (English) IAT wanted to build a new online loyalty platform in a short span of time. PGS Software knew that the best way to do that would be to use the AWS Cloud to develop a robust yet easily scalable and secure solution. (English) The core infrastructure was in place but the PGS Software team had to build the actual platform. The team put a lot of work into making epoints fast and secure, and into integrating it with a long list of partner sites and reward providers. (English) Having worked with PGS Software resources on various different projects over the 4 years of our engagement, I am in a good position to verify that adding PGS Software resources to a new or existing project will increase levels of insight, velocity, quality, and resilience. (English) Instant Access Technologies (IAT) helps businesses connect, motivate and reward customers, partners and employees through innovative digital solutions.

For Kristin Armstrong, the path from University of Idaho student to three-time Olympic gold medalist was one of determination and grit. While she’s now a household name for cycling excellence, the longtime Boise resident didn’t necessarily shine at UI for her athletic prowess. Armstrong learned that grit in the classrooms at UI, where she focused on her studies, but was also part of a supportive environment where she could connect with her professors and be held accountable for the work she did. It also took focus for her to excel and find balance among her various passions, whether it was bonding with her sisters at Kappa Kappa Gamma, training for a season with the track and cross-country teams, keeping her body and mind healthy, or taking part in intramurals — including ultimate Frisbee, soccer and softball. “The college experience that I dreamed of having, I had at the University of Idaho,” said Armstrong, who has had a distinguished career in sports medicine after graduating from the College of Education in 1995. Her intentions were to go on to physical therapy or physician’s assistant school, but after realizing she couldn’t do it all, she followed the path of becoming a professional athlete. Armstrong would take up cycling in the years following her time at UI. She went on to earn gold medals in the cycling time trial at the 2008 Beijing, 2012 London and 2016 Rio Olympic games. That achievement — as well as her passion for helping others live active, healthy lives — is why UI officials chose to rename the portion of Paradise Path that crosses UI’s campus the Kristin Armstrong Bike Path. The path will be dedicated Sept. 9. It’s not the first route named in Armstrong’s honor: The road to the Bogus Basin ski area, a popular cycling route near Boise, also is named for her — a fact she said keeps fellow cyclists inspired as they climb to the base elevation at 5,790 feet. “I’ve had fellow cyclists say all they wanted to do halfway up the mountain is turn around and then they see my sign and say, ‘Kristin Armstrong wouldn’t turn around,’” she said. While Paradise Path may not boast a several-thousand-foot rise in elevation, Armstrong still hopes the newly named bike path will inspire generations of families and kids in the community, as well as the students who use it for their commute. “The University of Idaho was great to me, I learned so much there,” Armstrong said. The supportive environment and overall college experience is one she looks back on with fondness. A longtime Boise resident, Armstrong recently retired from competitive cycling after winning a third gold medal last summer in Rio. She and husband Joe Savola – also a UI alum – have one son, Lucas, age 7. Armstrong spends her time public speaking, being a mom and recently accepted a job with USA Cycling. She will serve as USA Cycling’s endurance performance director, helping the next generation of Olympic cyclists go after their dreams of gold during the 2020 games in Tokyo. “I can’t imagine anything better than helping the best cyclist in the nation bring home the gold. I have four Olympics under my belt and have a lot of experiences to share. And, of course, will continue to put my sports medicine degree from UI to good use,” she said. Due to air quality concerns, parade is canceled.

Do you live and make decisions from your head or from your heart? We can feel the difference right? Decisions from the heart feel warm and fuzzy and full of love. Decisions from the head usually feel steeped in logical thinking and can at times be devoid of compassion. Decisions from the heart seem risky and vulnerable, while decisions from our heads feel safe, cautious and reasonable. ​What would the world look like and feel like if we ventured down that long 12-18 inch space from our head to our heart? Making decisions and choices guided by our heart. ​Why is it that leading with our heart feels so vulnerable and risky? Why is it that we feel a need to protect ourselves and put up walls? The need to protect our power, our privilege, our dreams, our money. We are cultured to believe that leading from our heart would not be beneficial, that it would be irresponsible and even stupid. How many times have we received advice or given advice based on sheer logic and intellect with a disregard for the teachings of the heart? I'm not suggesting that we be reckless and dangerous, but I am suggesting that we allow ourselves to be guided by our heart. That we listen to our heart and the wisdom that is has to offer and is teaching us. That we be guided by compassion, forgiveness, love and grace, instead of fear. I like how authors Ed and Deb Shapiro explain it, "The heart has been described as the king, with the mind as the king's adviser. When faced with a decision, the king may ask his advisers for advice, may even send them out into the world to gather information, but ultimately it is the king that makes the final decision. Even though the advisers do not always agree with the king's decision, the king is invariably right, because the king's view not only sees the bigger picture but is also aware of the needs of others." They go on to explain, "In the same way, when faced with a decision or conflict, your mind may come up with numerous, different and quite logical reasons why you should act as it advises, but if you listen to and trust your heart—however illogical or irrational it may seem—it is usually right and you are happier as a result." ​Your heart is where your intuition resides. If we get still and listen, it is full of wisdom. The heart and its powerful energy is what I believe our world needs more than anything our minds can conjure up. When we tap into the wisdom of our heart we are in alignment with the truth of our being. The essence of who we are, our higher self. There is so much value to listening to our hear,t as it is the essence of our spiritual being. Before you make that decision or choice, take time to pause, be still and listen to the guidance of your heart. Ask yourself what you value and what is in alignment with the truth of your being. Will your decision support these values, will it be in alignment? I invite you to practice letting go of your fear and your need to control, and to listen more to the wisdom of your heart. Let it guide you while your mind advises you. ​Next week's post will include a process for making decisions that are led by the heart. Typically, these are decisions that will help to support your overall happiness. This week I want to share with you a really important and impactful daily practice that I learned from Brene Brown's book Braving The Wilderness. It goes hand-in-hand with some affirmations that I also love to use (more on these later). Here is Brene's recommended daily practice, "Stop walking through the world looking for confirmation that you don't belong. You will always find it because you've made that your mission. Stop scouring people's faces for evidence that you're not enough. You will always find it because you've made that your goal. True belonging and self-worth are not goods; we don't negotiate their value with the world. The truth about who we are lives in our hearts. Our call to courage is to protect our wild heart against constant evaluation, especially our own. No one belongs here more than you." Do you consider yourself to be your worst critic? I think a lot of us are hard on ourselves, probably a lot harsher than anyone else (most of the time anyway). We often take this self criticism and reflect it outward by looking for confirmation from others that we don't belong, or that we are not enough. It then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy of sorts. I don't know about you, but I can still sometimes get caught up in bashing myself for things I wish I wouldn't have done or said from decades ago. Things I can in no way change and that no one, besides myself, is even remembering let alone thinking about anymore. Do you do that too? What if we quit walking around each day looking for reasons that we don't belong or that we're not good enough? What would life look like? There are a few affirmations that I've worked with over the years that I really love and have helped me walk through life with a different mindset. The first one is super simple, it's "I am enough." That's it, short and sweet, "I am enough." Repeating it over and over to myself until it sinks into my bones. The second one is a little longer, but it carries with it magic. This one is thanks to my friend Haywood Simmons. It goes like this, "I am enough and I bring creative solutions everywhere I go." If I'm faced with a challenge of any kind this is my go to affirmation. Repeating it over and over to myself until it seeps into my bones..."I am enough and I bring creative solutions wherever I go." This simple "I am enough" affirmation can be modified however it works for you. It's a powerful reminder that we belong and we are enough, just the way we are...perfectly and uniquely imperfect. Just the way God created us to be. Imagine how we might show up for the world if we were all feeling adequate. Imagine if our mindset was in place to believe that we were enough and could bring creative solutions wherever we went. What might be possible if we felt whole and complete? What if we didn't let our own fear take over and rule us? Imagine the possibilities. I invite you to give it a try. Walk through the world with affirmations of being enough and stop looking for confirmation that you are not. See how you feel. I would love to hear how it goes! Do you feel lonely? Loneliness and being alone can be very different things. We can feel lonely even when we are amongst a crowd. It can actually be a more painful feeling, a lonelier feeling than when we are physically alone. Have you experienced feeling lonely when you are with the people or when you are alone? I know I have. Maybe it's because you feel like you don't fit in, or that you aren't accepted, aren't seen or heard, maybe because you don't feel like you're enough. Neuroscience researcher John Cacioppo has been studying loneliness for over 20 years. He defines loneliness as, "perceived social isolation." We experience loneliness when we feel disconnected. Therefore, loneliness is not just being alone. Loneliness is a state of mind. Did you know that loneliness is bad for your health? Based on the results of numerous studies on loneliness, researchers have found that: Living with air pollution increases your odds of dying early by 5%. Living with obesity by 20%. Excessive drinking by 30%. And living with loneliness increases your odds of dying early by a whooping 45%. The need for social connection is so fundamental in humans that without it we fall apart, down to the cellular level. According to Brene Brown in her book, Braving The Wilderness, in 1980 approximately 20% of Americans reported feeling lonely. Today, it's more than double that percentage. Rates of loneliness are rapidly increasing not only in America, but also in countries around the world. It seems strange doesn't it that in 2018 we would be feeling more lonely? I mean we are more "connected" than ever aren't we? We have email and cell phones, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and Snapchat, we have airline travel all making staying "connected" so much easier. In recent years our society has been promoting the idea of sorting ourselves into groups of like-minded people. As Bill Bishop in his book, The Big Sort, states, "We’ve geographically, politically, and even spiritually sorted ourselves into like-minded groups in which we silence dissent, grow more extreme in our thinking, and consume only facts
I stumbled across some very interesting science kit, the EmDrive (Wikipedia link). To explain why this is so remarkable takes a little bit of rocket science. When we go to space, we propel ourselves by throwing things out of the spacecraft at high speed. Accelerating the mass out of the spacecraft provides a force that accelerates the spacecraft in the opposite direction. This is the stuff Isaac Newton wrote about. "Force is equal to Mass times Acceleration." This means that it is a viable means to propel your spacecraft by having a Baseball pitcher stand in the airlock and throw fastballs out into deep space. With every throw, the ship gets a nudge in the opposite direction. The problem with this is that baseballs, and rocket fuel in general, is heavy and we have to haul it all up into orbit with us before doing anything interesting. If the emDrive works, we don't need any more baseballs. We can convert electricity directly into motion. If it works this is a civilization-changing invention like the discovery of fire, the invention of the printing press, or the invention of the steam engine. It can fundamentally alter the course of the human race. That seems like pretty big shoes to fill. I'll explain. The way spaceflight works today is we burn a bunch of fuel at the beginning of the flight, and coast to where we're going. If we're lucky, we can "slingshot" around a moon or planet to help us get moving really fast. This method works. We've used it to fly-by every planet in our Solar System. It might take a while, but we'll get there eventually. With "propellant-less propulsion" like the emDrive we can change how we fly. Instead of coasting "down the hill" we can accelerate almost all the way to Mars. Our flight times can go from Months to Days. Exploration and Colonization move from Science Fiction to "Next Year." Scuba-dive on Europa? I can't see why not. I've said a couple of times in this post "If it works". That is a big "if". Mr. Newton's physics have been around a long time, and this breaks them. That is a big deal, and a lot more research needs to be done to nail down the new science. The inventor is off to an excellent start. He's published his work and it's been replicated at least twice. He's got working models that produce meter-grams of force, and theoretical models that can lift a car with less energy that we use now to drive. Sign me up. If I were in High School today, I would go to University and study to work in this field. The growth opportunities from this make the dot-com boom look like kindergarten. I'm not in High School, but I'm still going to try. I'm reading "Microwave Engineering" tonight, and packing in a bunch of coursework. The technology is still a baby, and I'm definitely getting in. This is going to be huge! Remember the Flying cars in the Jetson's, Star Wars, and every other sci-fi show since you were 6? This is the technology that makes that a real thing. Nobody else is going to build me a flying car, I guess I will have to do it myself! My Daughter and I are learning Spanish together. We're using this great website, DuoLingo.com. The idea is that she and I will be able to talk with our "secret language" Sounds great, right? It is. One minor complicating factor. My son wants a secret language too. Yep. I'm learning German and Spanish simultaneously. ich bin ein Pingüino? Ella es eine Frau? I just finished reading The Martian by Andy Weir. This is a survival science fiction novel that tells the tale of a man's struggle to survive and escape Mars after being left behind, presumed dead, on an early manned mission. The book is absolutely fantastic. I read it in one sitting, and could not put it down. 9,000 stars, 1 billion internets. Fantastic. Normally I put a link here to the book on Amazon. Here it is. Also, I'm placing a link to download the .ePub of the full book for free on my public dropbox here. Copyright Info “The Martian” is copyright © Andy Weir, 2011. Al rights reserved.

They can't remember to brush their teeth for anything. This gave me a lovely idea today. I should manufacture a toothbrush that starts playing music if it sits still for 24 continuous hours. The only way to stop the music should be to shake it (i.e. by brushing your teeth) for 30 seconds. Today I got Gmail reminder to "check up on that free energy stuff". The e-Cat system (LENR, not free energy) still remains a black box, despite the company's claim that they have one in production. I think I'm going to have to build one of these to sate my curiosity. The Orbo team is producing the resounding sounds of Crickets. The EMC2 (Fusion, not free energy) team is back at work. It looks like they were able to wrangle some dollars out of the Navy. Lovely. I think I will have a go at the E-Cat. It seems like fairly simple rig to try. BTW, sorry for the long sabbatical I'm juggling some projects at work and have been reading a lot. I should have book posts this week about "Frozen in Time" (historical non-fiction about Airplanes on Greenland) and "The Interrogators" (non-fiction about the experience of a military interrogator in Afghanistan.) I'm also working on a swing for my daughter and doing some car stuff too!

Onboarding is defined by Merriam-Webster as “the act or process of orienting and training a new employee.” Of course, you have the mandatory items that need completed right away to do this, I-9, W-4, et cetera. Create a plan for these immediate aspects of onboarding and keep it consistent among all new hires. After you’ve done that, there is no right or wrong, or proven method and length of time for employee onboarding. However, I can share some tips that have served me well over the years. From what I have discovered, the first 90 days are the most critical. During this time, the employee is getting to know the company’s values, it’s employees, and his or her own job. By providing a structured onboarding process to train the new employee, you are showing them you want them to be successful. For example, have them sit with a more seasoned employee, giving them a mentor, and allowing them to make a connection. A piece of caution is to make sure the seasoned employee has the time to train and mentor, so they don’t feel overwhelmed. During the onboarding process, show the new hire the ropes, train on technology needed to successfully do their job, show them around the facility and introduce them to people. Try not to rush this process since, as we all know, starting a new job is stressful. Providing employees with a copy of the policies and a short video or presentation about the company is great, but it shouldn’t stop there. Let new hires know what the company’s expectations are and what they will be evaluated on. Providing an open dialogue between new employees and senior leadership sets a standard early on. Allowing a new employee to make new working relationships with various levels of employees helps to make them feel welcomed. Also, check in with them! Receiving feedback from a new employee on what they are learning and how they feel helps to build a positive culture. As we all know, positive cultures lead to better retention rates and a more productive staff. There is an array of technology for employee orientations and onboarding processes, which is great for streamlining process and keeping things consistent. You can show a PowerPoint presentation to introduce the company, provide employee portals to communicate with staff, and offer online learning tools. Onboarding technology can also help you to stay focused and provide checklists. While these options can be very helpful, don’t forget to put the human interactions in as well. As an example, instead of sending an email to check-in with the new hire, make an appointment with them and have a conversation. As stated previously, there is no perfect way to conduct an employee onboarding, though hopefully these tips will help. The important thing is to do one.
The Russian Foreign Ministry warned the EU against hindering the Nord Stream 2 project, stated Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Alexander Pankin in an interview with RIA Novosti. Pankin stated that if obstacles are created to force Russia to pump gas through Ukraine “on their terms, their tariffs and their legal uncertainties, then this would not work”. He pointed to possible difficulties that European consumers could have if Russia and Ukraine fail to reach an agreement on gas transit and “if the problems with Nord Stream 2 remain." At the same time, he stated that Russia is ready to continue gas transit to Europe through Ukraine. "We are ready to continue transit through Ukraine, but on the conditions that we need,” Pankin stated, suggesting that after the Presidential elections, Ukraine's position may change. Pankin suggested that a change in position, certain institutional developments, or a legal development in the processes could occur in Ukraine by next May. Nord Stream 2 has already been criticized by some European countries. The gas pipeline would be laid under the Baltic Sea along with the already-existing Nord Stream line. Russia plans to complete the project this year, when agreements between Moscow and Kyiv on gas transit through Ukraine expire. Earlier, the European Union supported a compromise solution by amending the EU third energy package. According to the amendments, the EU member state holding the primary traffic artery connecting to European gas pipelines grids would be responsible for the gas pipeline coming from the third country. Thus, the German government, not Brussels, would regulate Nord Stream 2.

Ethereum is one of the leading cryptocurrencies in the world owing to its vast applications.

When I first heard of GO2 and its effects, I was quite excited.. I’ve tried loads of vitamins and liquids that all profess to put the energy back in your life. Well… Here’s the difference with GO2…. It actually works! From the first day I started using it, I have felt more energetic than I have in a loooooong time. Since having mr 2.5, and having some weight and health issues, I’ve felt slow and tired, all. the. time. My morning would start at 6:30am getting up with the little one, getting him sorted, then sitting down for my breakfast, and I would literally need 3 strong coffees before feeling like I had energy and motivation to get things done. Sometimes, unless mr 2.5 needed me, I struggled to get moving until 10/10:30am. Life just felt hard. So when I was lucky enough to have the chance to try GO2, I prayed that I finally found the booster I desperately needed… I wasn’t disappointed! That first day I took the recommended amount as soon as I was up, and everything just rolled from there, I got my son sorted, I had only ONE! coffee that morning, and before it was even finished, I was trying to CONTAIN the energy to move and get things done!! By 10:30am my chores for the day were mostly done and I was thinking about having a second coffee for coffee break instead of motivation. And it’s not stopped since then. Every day has been the same. I love that it doesn’t feel like I’ve used a booster to give me energy too, it feels natural. I cannot rate GO2 highly enough! It’s given me my life back.

A light summer pasta dish with black pepper bacon & feta with red wine vinegar for a kick. A delicious and easy picnic or summer get together side. 4 large fresh Basil leaves chopped. Cook the pasta according to instructions and drain. Fry the 8 strips of bacon until crispy. While the pasta and bacon are cooking, chop the onions into a medium dice. Next pat the oil from the sun dried tomatoes and either dice them or pulse in a food processor. When the bacon is done chop into bacon bits. Chop the basil leaves into small pieces. Place the pasta in a large bowl and add the bacon, onions, sun dried tomatoes, and basil. Add feta crumbles, red wine vinegar, and mayo and blend thoroughly with the other ingredients. This recipe was fun for me to make because it gave me a chance to practice some of what I’ve been learning in cooking school the last few weeks. My chopping skills need lots of practice but I can see myself getting better and more comfortable! I got little plastic cutting boards similar to the ones we’ve been using in class and they’re great for non slip and so handy to fold and use to pour into the prep bowls. I also picked up the little prep bowls after using them in class and seeing how efficient it is to add your ingredients after you’ve chopped each of them to a little bowl and they’re ready to go when you’re ready to prepare the dish! The big game changer for me though were the onion goggles I discovered in class. My eyes are super sensitive to chopping onions and it always gives me fits when I cook. I may look like Elton John when I wear them but the onions won’t go breaking my heart any more! I love the colors of the recipe and how light it is. Just perfect for a summer meal with the crunch of the bacon (I used black pepper bacon for extra flavor but you can use any kind of bacon.), the creamy but tart feta, and the tang of the mayo and vinegar. Lots of flavors happening here! This easy pasta salad does require a bit of chopping (Maybe you need practice too? Haha!) but it’s not hard and it’s so versatile- a side for a picnic or as I did low-maintenance meals while the hubs is away! You can see my Southwest Pasta Salad from last summer here. Just FYI I’ve been drooling over this for days. FOR DAYS.

China is set to achieve its annual economic growth targets despite the weak global economy, Premier Li Keqiang said at a news conference on March 16. The country also has policy tools in place to anchor the economy if “it slides below the appropriate range”, he said after the closing meeting of the fourth session of the 12th National People’s Congress in Beijing. The country will promote market competition and encourage innovation to unleash the economy’s potential, Premier Li said. China is carrying out supply-side reform and pressing ahead with many market-boosting measures, such as the administrative streamlining initiative, to provide better services and facilitate business startups, he said. The country still has ample room for investment to boost the economy, the Premier said, in the underdeveloped central and western regions, for example. Premier Li also said the authorities will step up financial supervision through better coordination between relevant departments, to ward off risks presented by the many financial innovation products on the market and the interconnection of different financial sectors. “Coordination will be improved in financial regulation”, he said. China has resorted to reducing interest rates and banks’ reserve requirement ratio to boost its economy after its GDP grew by 6.9 percent year-on-year in 2015, the slowest pace since 1990. The Premier said the aim of these moves was to stabilize the economy, not monetary easing. China has set a GDP growth target of 6.5-7 percent for this year. The country plans to raise the deficit to GDP ratio to 3 percent this year, compared with 2.4 percent last year. More than 2,800 deputies attended the closing meeting of the 12th NPC fourth session, which started on March 5.

Karl Hoffmann (26 February 1915, Hof – 21 May 1996, Erlangen) was a German linguist who specialized in Indo-European and Indo-Iranian studies. He is most recognized for his achievements in his studies of Vedic Sanskrit, Avestan and Old Persian languages. Karl Hoffmann was born the son of a railway official in Upper Palatinate, Bavaria. His family later moved to the state capital of Munich, where he remained for the duration of his childhood. In 1934, Hoffmann began his education in Indo-European studies, which he continued until he was called in for military service for Nazi Germany at the start of World War II in 1939. Hoffmann took his leave from the war during 1941, just long enough to receive his doctorate for his unpublished dissertation, titled Die altindoarischen Wörter mit -ṇḍ- besonders im Ṛgveda. Hoffmann was at the Russian front until 1943, after which he joined the Indian Legion (Indische Legion), together with other German Indologists, such as Paul Thieme and Gustav Roth. Once World War II had ended in 1945, Hoffmann returned to Munich, and was able to continue his academic work in Indo-Iranian studies. In 1951, he qualified as a university lecturer with his habilitation thesis, Der Injunktiv im Veda. In 1952, Hoffmann moved to Saarbrücken, Saarland, where he taught Indo-European linguistics to his students at Saarland University. He continued teaching this course until 1955, when he accepted the chair of comparative linguistics at Friedrich-Alexander-University, Erlangen-Nuremberg. He was offered a position at the University of Bonn in 1962, but refused, and thus remained in Erlangen until his retirement in 1983.

After a seven-year lapse, industry authority Seafish brought Seafood Week back in October 2015 to promote the product. But in order to ensure that consumers actually bought more seafish, the authority had to encourage partners, such as supermarkets, mongers and restaurants, to get involved in the promotional week as it has no control over marketing mix elements. It aimed to provide a campaign event platform to deliver media and digital noise but also one that offered flexibility across all elements of the supply chain for companies to get involve. Seafish set itself a target of delivering media reach of 50 million and social reach of 40 million, and to gain support from five major partners. The campaign strategy was shaped by insights from Neilson, Kantar and other sources, while Experian Mosaic provided insight into customer groups. Seafish created a series of free resources and assets that offered advice to participating businesses on how they could get involved, such as information on how to work with local media and downloadable press release templates. It encouraged them to set up social media accounts if they had not them already, and to start using #seafoodweek ahead of the event, sharing favourite seafood recipes or memories to generate interest. A calendar suggested the types of posts that could be sent in the run up and through Seafood Week, highlighting the promotion that the business offered as a ‘call to action’. Marketing materials, such as posters, digital adverts and stickers, were also available. Seafood Week kicked off on 7 October with Fish Pun Day, when Seafish encouraged partners to share pictures of fish with related puns. Each day of the week also showcased one species, such as cod, mussels or sardines, with alternatives offered: retailers suggested ‘buy me’ or ‘cook me’ while restaurants said ‘dine me’. Seafish also ran a series of events, such as taking fishermen to primary schools, while it worked with mainstream media, providing experts such as a nutritionist and national pun champion Darren Walsh, for interviews. Over the week, the event achieved 213 items of coverage in national and regional newspapers, and 36 broadcast interviews. On social media, #seafoodweek reached 53.8 million impressions while #fishpunday achieved 11.5 million and even www.seafoodweek.co.uk saw 41,500 unique visitors over eight days. Around 300 businesses across the country got involved, including Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and Co-operative Food. Seafish secured ten major partners, against its target of four, and the week is estimated to have produced between £7 million and £18 million to the industry, providing a return on investment of at least 25:1. The event is returning in October 2016. The judges described this as ‘a strong campaign across a blend of owned, earned and paid media, delivering great channel and business results’.

Gymnodinium, genus of marine or freshwater dinoflagellate algae (family Gymnodiniaceae). Like all dinoflagellates, members of the genus feature two flagella and have both plantlike and animal-like characteristics. Some may be bioluminescent or form periodic water blooms that may colour water yellow or red. A few species produce a toxin similar to that of the dinoflagellate Gonyaulax; both toxins are fatal to fish and can irritate the nose and throat of humans if inhaled. Members of the genus are usually bilaterally symmetrical with a delicate pellicle (envelope) and lack the cellulosic armour of other dinoflagellate species. Many have disk-shaped chromatophores, which contain yellow, brown, green, or blue pigments. Some species are photosynthetic, whereas others are heterotrophic and require solid food. Colonial species form long chains. Sexual reproduction often results in hypnozygotes (thick-walled resting cysts) that can remain dormant in mud and other sediments until conditions are favourable for growth. Asexual reproduction is primarily through binary fission.
"My, you’re looking thin… AND very, uh, happy to see me!" One candidate that Dr. Cummings described as the “darling” of obesity researchers would be a drug that could stimulate a brain structure called the melanocortin-4 receptor, to decrease appetite and cause weight loss. But side effects always loom, and one drug tested in animals made them lose weight but also caused erections. “That may sound great, but when the erections are unsolicited and prolonged, that’s a bad side effect,” Dr. Cummings said. “Solicting erections” is an odd phrase. Inducing them or causing them I can imagine. and shouldn’t this be in Dance category ;-).

Not just an indulgence, it’s the ultimate indulgence. Delizioso! Absolutely delicious. Flavor and quality are superior. Delicious, my favorite tomato soup accompaniment.

There is a wage for doing wrong, but there is a recompense for doing right. Romans 6:23 says, “For the wages of sin is death…” It is interesting that sin has a wage, but righteousness has a recompense. A wage is something that you have earned, while a recompense is something for which you are reimbursed. In other words, you are investing when you do righteousness, but you are building debt when you commit sin. It is always better to be recompensed for the acts that you do than to have to pay the wage for what you do. God says in the verse above, “Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth…” Not only will God reimburse you for what you do for Him, but He will make sure that you are reimbursed for your righteous actions while you are alive. In Proverbs 11, God shows several ways that He recompenses you for doing right. First, God recompenses you by delivering you from financial death. Verse 4 says, “Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivereth from death.” Many have gone into financial ruin because of their sin. One of the easiest ways to get out of debt is to start doing right. Sin is expensive, and the money you spend on sin could be put towards paying down debt if you would stop committing sin. Second, God recompenses you by directing your way. Verse 5 says, “The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way…” You will find it is much easier to discern what to do in life if you will live right. Righteousness has a way of giving you common sense and discernment for daily living. If you want to keep yourself walking in the right way, you had better keep yourself doing right. Third, God recompenses you by keeping you out of trouble. Verses 6 and 8 show that doing right keeps you out of trouble. If you find yourself constantly getting into trouble, you might want to see how many righteous acts you have been doing lately. You will find that those who get into trouble regularly are those who habitually commit sin. If you don’t want to build a wrong reputation, then stop doing wrong and you won’t be known as the one who always does wrong. It is always better to build a testimony of doing right than to have a reputation as the one who always does wrong. Fourth, God recompenses you by giving you a “sure reward.” In other words, doing right builds a secure life that you won’t quickly lose. Those who do right tend to find themselves having secure assets which are not quickly lost. If you want your life to be stable, you would be wise to live a righteous life. Fifth, God recompenses you by giving you the right desires. Verse 23 says, “The desire of the righteous is only good…” Righteous acts produce righteous desires. If you’re struggling with doing wrong, you would be wise to start doing right because you will see the recompense for doing right is that God changes your desires to do right. Sixth, God recompenses you by making you fruitful. Verse 30 says, “The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life…” The person who lives a righteous life will find themselves being fruitful in the work of the LORD. If you try to win the lost for Christ continually, you will be pleased with God’s recompense of your actions by giving you fruit to enjoy.
The project consisted of stabilizing and restoring vault spaces below the ambulance ramp of Woodhull Medical Center. The vault houses Con Edison electrical transformers that serve the medical center. SUPERSTRUCTURES modified its investigation procedure, detailing of the work, and the contractor's construction sequencing to adapt to the confined space of the vaults and the presence of the high voltage transformers. The firm issued construction documents and specifications for the shoring and the restoration of the vault compartments and provided bidding assistance and construction administration services.
PetMed Express reported earnings which missed on both the top line & bottom line, causing their shares to fall about 12% in pre-market trade. Almost immediately after the market opened up shares ramped up hard in a bull trap, which had shares up above $23 each within 45 minutes of open. They were only down a little over a percent at the peak, while the broader stock market was also down a similar amount. And then the share price slid like a rock until 12:30 PM, bottoming at $20.25 a share. I wanted to trade the initial ramp, but knew it would eventually turn back, so I sat on my hands until after the stock bottomed & started turning up. I put on a dead cat bounce trade when it was about $20.6 a share, though I got a crappy fill at about $20.83 a share. I looked away from the market for about an hour, came back & saw shares at $21.28, so I sold at market, which was executed at $21.2346, for a gain of about $580 on 1,500 shares. The company has no debt, $93.2 million in cash, $32.2 million in inventory, a 5.16% dividend yield and a market cap of about $432 million. They’d be a great buy for someone like Mars who perhaps wanted to own a slice of online distribution to limit the negotiation leverage of Chewy. Back out their inventory & cash on hand and that shaves over a quarter off their absurdly low P/E ratio. They are no longer a growth story as about 90% of their orders are repeat customers. Reorder sales increased by 4.6% to $53.3 million for the quarter compared to reorder sales of $50.9 million for the same quarter the prior year. For the 9 months, the reorder sales increased by 9% to $185.9 million compared to $170.5 million for the same period a year ago. New order sales decreased by 26% to $6.8 million for the quarter compared to $9.2 million for the same period the prior year. Newer customers have been harder to find online as the size of ads in the search results has increased dramatically over the past couple years, lowering the relative value of organic rankings in the vertical. Ad prices have went up as well, and they’ve sort of sat on their hands with a relatively flat ad budget, instead of passing all their margins onto Google. They’ve also lowered product prices to stay competitive on the price front. On the conference call they mentioned they planned on increasing their ad spend offline to compliment their online advertising, as online ad rates were up over 10% in the quarter, driving new customer acquisition cost up to $45 from $39 last year. Their shares are off over 60% from the 52-week high of $51.60. Considering that they have no debt, are cashflow positive & over a quarter of their market cap is cash + inventory, that is quite a steep fall. I wouldn’t be surprised if a value investor pushed for a sale of the company or a PE firm bought them out, stripped the cash, loaded them up on debt, expanded them beyond medications to have a growth story which masks the cash stripping & justifies temporary losses, then listed them public again in a couple years. During the December stock market rout eBay did not fall as much as most other tech plays, in part because a couple activist value investors were accumulating a significant stake in the company. eBay closed today up 6.13% on the suggestions by Elliot Management Corp. and Starboard Value LP to split the classifieds-ad business & StubHub from core eBay.
The India I love is timeless and unruffled by the ways of the world. India I love is in the villages, in the drapes of the sari, in the bells of the temples at sunrise, in the hands joined in a respectful Namaste. But India that changes is also there, forcing me to take notice of its boisterous ways, its magnificent achievements, its chaotic development. So here I am, on my third journey to India. I decided to stay in Delhi for a couple of days to immerse myself in contemporary India, not very convinced though, that I will be able to love it. Arnima, my kamalan travel consultant, has been categorical, “I would not suggest that you go to Gurgaon. It is the “Mecca” of high-tech India, but even though its name means “the village of raw sugar, there will be nothing sweet about travelling there. It is very far from the city and the traffic will certainly put you off.” She knows me well by now, and I trust her judgment. I stay at The Rose, an unconventional, well-decorated hotel in Hauz Khas, an ancient hamlet engulfed by the city, that has been invested in by numberless boutiques, cafes, art galleries, jazz clubs, and even an organic restaurant. Despite being taken over by what in the West would be called a “hipsters’ groove”, the place retains the feel of a village, with the ubiquitous cows strolling side by side. It is Saturday afternoon when I venture out to visit a museum of contemporary art that sounds quite promising in spite the fact that it is in a mall; I don’t really know what to expect. The DLF mall in Saket is more than I’ve asked for; it is a sort of amusement park for grown-ups, willing to embrace “modernity” in sprees of binge-shopping. The search for my longed-for museum proves a little taxing; I wish I had asked for the help of a professional guide who would have accompanied me smoothly to my destination. Finally, when one of the numerous guards protecting this huge temple of consumerism directs me to an information counter, I manage to find my way. I enter a vast hall invested with a huge installation by Subodh Gupta called “Line of control”. A young couple walks by this sort of nuclear mushroom made of stainless steel pots and pans, holding hands; not a very common sight in timeless India. Behind the glass doors of the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art, all is quiet and collected. At the counter I am only asked to sign my name, there is no ticket to be purchased, no fees to be paid, no books or souvenirs to be bought. I learn that this is India’s largest philanthropic museum, and is part of the Shiv Nadar Foundation, a non-profit organization that, among other activities, exhibits modern and contemporary art from India and the subcontinent. I am struck by the contrast between the bustling activity outside and the peaceful atmosphere I am enveloped in as soon as I enter the first exhibition hall. Only Bhimsen Joshi, one of the most accomplished voices of Indian classical music, accompanies my thoughts. The title of the exhibition is: “Difficult loves”, reminding me of a collection of short stories by Italo Calvino, one of my favourite authors with whom I share the country of birth, Italy. I feel immediately attracted to the part of the exhibition dedicated to Amrita Sher-Gil, celebrating her 100th birthday anniversary, “The self in making”. An iconic figure in the male dominated world of Indian art in the 1920s, the artist, who died too young at 28, shines through the self-portraits and the photographs taken by her father, in a room not too big that allows a surprising intimacy with the beautiful woman she was. I intend to buy few books on her work to bring home during my travel in North India. When I shared my love for books with Arnima, she suggested that I visit the bookshop at the Rambagh Palace in Jaipur, according to her, a treasure trove of rare books. It is difficult to describe the emotional engagement I have experienced in the halls devoted to the work of Nasreen Mohamedi, a woman artist born in Karachi who lived in London and Paris and, among other places, in the Middle East. She finally chose India as her home where she taught at the Faculty of Fine Arts in the University of Baroda. Roobina Karode, a former student of Nasreen Mohamedi, has curated the exhibition I am visiting, pertinently called: “A view to infinity”. Through a series of black and white family photographs, I become acquainted with a charming woman gifted with an intelligent gaze. I love the portrait she took of Husain, one of the most well-known Indian artists, dressed in black, standing with open arms, almost a christic figure. It is the exposure to her work, though, that produces a very strong inner movement in me. I immediately sense the presence of a unique vision and a personal quest that exudes from the geometric patterns she drew on the paper, the photographs she took, her oil paintings. Hers is a feminine and rigorous approach to space and time; she seems to be able to translate to images the music of the spheres. "Nasreen Mohamedi was in tune with the cosmic womb and the eclipses of the sun and the moon, the cycles of birth and decay and of continual change. Through the intense acuity of her perception, she realises that nature disposes itself in rhythm and only through rhythm one is able to escape time." The essence of what I feel is a feminine perception of life is there in front of me, a sort of formula that has eluded me for long time. I walk out of the exhibition in awe of the artist, considering myself very lucky to have discovered her.
Mechanisms of Transcription offers a different viewpoint at the basic procedures of transcription. a suite of distinct authors attracts jointly the underlying mechanisms keen on the method of transcription. This contains RNA polymerase functionality and its interplay with promoter sequences, and the constructions of some of the elements at the transcriptional equipment. either prokaryotic and eukaryotic structures, NMR and crystallographic buildings of a couple of very important eukaryotic transcription elements are mentioned, in addition to the position of chromatin structure. This quantity comprises the lawsuits of the 3rd in a sequence of biennial NEC Symposia on primary ways to New fabric levels backed by means of the NEC company, Tokyo, Japan.

SEVERINOVl, and E. SEVERINOVA l 1 Introduction The core RNA polymerases from bacterial and eukaryotic cells, which are homologous in structure and function (Allison et al. 1996), suggest that cr factors may be structurally organized into relatively independent domains connected by linker regions. We recently used limited proteolysis to probe the domain organization of E. coli 0"70, showing that this may indeed be the case (Severinova et al. 1996).

I Love Clowns. Do You Love Clowns? I love clowns. I do. When I was a young lad, I dreamed of going to Clown College. Happy clowns and sad ones; slapstick and mimes; harlequins and tramps. I love them all. Well, almost. I didn’t like Pennywise. In this strange new world in which we find ourselves living, we occasionally encounter clowns that are wicked, or downright evil. I’m not going to talk about them, though. Clowns are meant to make us happy. They entertain us with their physical comedy. As a child of the 50s and 60s, I grew up with Bozo, The World’s Most Famous Clown and his cartoon show. Emmett Kelly’s Weary Willie was a sad, forlorn figure while Red Skelton’s Freddie the Freeloader brought more humor to the character. What about you? Do you love clowns or are you one of those poor unfortunates who suffers from coulrophobia? This entry was posted in Random Musings, Writing and tagged Bozo, Clowns, Coulrophobia, Emmett Kelly, Freddie the Freeloader, happy, Pennywise, random thoughts, Red Skelton, Weary Willie. Bookmark the permalink. 3 Responses to I Love Clowns. Do You Love Clowns? When my father became too old to get around much, he took up painting. His favorite was clowns, with Emmett Kelly being king of course. I have dad’s painting in my living room – so to answer your question – yes, I like clowns. Emmett Kelly was a favorite of my Grandparents and their daughter, my Mother. Naturally, he’s at the top of my list, too! Thanks a million for stopping by and saying a few words. A clown and a suitcase…Here’s a post where I am giving my personal definition of a clown as well as analyzing from what material the clown’s suitcase could be made, how it could be and what the clown could have put inside the suitcase.

We use administrative data on the population of corporations to investigate the distortion of corporate taxes on private firms, which account for 99% of all corporations. In response to a 9% increase in corporate tax rates, firms decrease income by 8.9%--5.5% due to reporting differences (e.g., tax shields) and 3.4% due to real differences (e.g., investment). We find differences in agency costs, investment frictions, and tax aggressiveness between firms using cash and accrual accounting and among small and large firms. Our estimates suggest that lowering the corporate tax rate from 35% to 25% would increase firm value by 16%.

Manager Gary Johnson praised the spirit shown by the Robins as his nine-man Cheltenham Town side went down 3-2 to Mansfield Town at the One Call Stadium. The Robins went ahead in the first half through Harry Pell’s penalty, but CJ Hamilton equalised before Taylor Moore was shown a straight red just before half-time. Mansfield were then reduced to ten men - when Hayden White was dismissed for a two-footed tackle - and Elijah Adebayo put Cheltenham back in front before another home equaliser was followed by a red card for Danny Wright. Hamilton then hit a 94th minute winner for the Stags to confirm a first away defeat at Mansfield in 15 years for battling Cheltenham. “The lads put in a good effort and when it went down to 10 versus 10 it looked like we could stay in it and keep the game, but when we go down to nine then it became a bit more of a problem,” said Johnson. “I was pleased with our performance today, I wanted a performance and a competitive spirit, and I thought we had that without being over the top. “I didn’t think it was a dirty game at all, but unfortunately the technical area makes it a dirty game. Adebayo came off the bench and scored his first Football League goal since joining on loan from Fulham, and Johnson was pleased with the impact the young striker made. “He took his goal very well and from that point we thought lovely, we are on for three points here,” added Johnson. “But six minutes were added on and obviously when a team is a man down and the other is a man up then they are going to put the ball into the box. “They earned their luck because they got numbers in the box.

Torch Property Management was started by a group of Property Managers whom have dedicated their careers to managing and help grow our client’s biggest investment. Generally, Property Management departments are started by default after a sales person sells a property to an investor; there is already the relationship between the purchaser and the agent thus making it easy for the agency to manage the property. Most real estate agencies see their rental department as a cash flow stream to help them achieve more sales. Their primary goal is to sell more property and eventually your investment. At Torch Property Management we only manage properties. We don’t have a sales department, our goal is solely to manage your property and provide the best service we can possibly give to you the property owner and also your tenant. Choosing the wrong property manager can be as detrimental as choosing the wrong investment option on the stock market or through your super fund. When choosing a property manager you must also ascertain how the property manager deals with your tenant. At the end of the day, without a great tenant you don’t have a great investment. Your property manager needs to be able to communicate effectively and efficiently with both you and your tenant. "Is your investment property being managed to its full potential?"

Harness the Power of Foods to Boost Your Mental Health! Alice has teamed up with established author, client and friend Rachel Kelly to create The Happy Kitchen – released January 2017. Order here! Since her last serious bout of depression in 2011, Rachel Kelly has evolved a broad holistic approach to staying well, but at the heart of her recovery has been changing the way she eats. Over the past five years, Alice has worked with Rachel to build up a repertoire of recipes that target particular symptoms, from insomnia and mood swings to stress and exhaustion. The result is a cookbook which offers something different: a wonderfully calming and pleasurable read, with delicious recipes and meal planners, as well as sections that cover the Golden Rules for a Happy Kitchen and Super Good Mood Foods. In “Nutrition Notes” scattered throughout the text, Alice explains the latest science on particular foods and their role in boosting our mental health. It was really important to the duo that everything is backed up with evidence, and you can see that evidence listed here. Follow Rachel and Alice’s advice, and without trying, you too will, week by week, become more energised, less anxious and cheerier. See the video below to learn more about The Happy Kitchen, our story and what the book is all about.

flare design flare flarenet afsa aspen flare system analyze 2 flare connected flare. I am designing a Flare System, and I would like help on how to model the flare system with multiple flares tips connected using Aspen Flare System Analyzer. I have to design Flare system where multiple flares tips are connected downstream the KOD. How do i split the flow to multiple flare tips (4 Nos). Is this possible with Aspen Flare System Analyzer, or is there a software that handles this simulation. I tried using the TEE but this does not seem to work. Flare System Analyzer aim to determine the pressure profile in the system while don't care what type of flare tip you use. Although your actual flare tip has 4 nozzles, you may consider it as one device and don't care about the flow distribution to each nozzle. The key parameter you need to focus is only the pressure drop across the tip vs the total relief flow (through 4 nozzles) and then input them into the program by using only one flare tip connected to the flare stack. What I mean 4 FLare Stack, not 4 flare nozzles. I have attached a Screen shot of what i want. I Highlighted the flow at each tee, for the 18" line, and 20" line. It doesnt seem to tally because, i expected more flow in the 20" line. Edited by Emamoke, 05 February 2019 - 07:37 AM. Despite the larger flow area, there appears to be quite a bit more resistance downstream of the 20 inch branch. It doesn't look too surprising to me. The high pressure drop across 20" pipe (Pipe31) is the reason you don't get the flow that you expect. One more point, there is something strange on connector6 which reduce the pressure of Pipe44 to be less than Pipe28. I just wonder about the bottleneck (18") in this flare network. if there is any reason behind the scene because I have never seen this kind of reduced pipe connected in between the flare header. The Reason why the network is such is because, 20" is an exisiting Flare. Infact, all the FLares are already existing. The plan is to tie the new KOD to the existing flare. Flare tip 2,3,4,5 are close to each other (and have the same header), while Flare tip 1 is far in the opposite direction (on a different header). Edited by Emamoke, 07 February 2019 - 04:14 AM.
TIP! Before you go to college, make a short list of items you’ll need to bring with you. Being prepared will make your experience much easier. Few things in life are as rewarding and overwhelming as planning for and attending college. It is a challenge to leave home and attend a school with a group of strangers. Fortunately, resources like this article are here to bolster your confidence and help you to feel more prepared. These tips will teach how to make college fun and rewarding. You’ll need grants and scholarships to get through college. Be sure to apply early. The more time you devote to securing funding for college, the less money you will need to borrow. Establish a sound deadline tracking system so that you never miss an important date. Keep in mind that you should be eating healthy while in college. There is truth to the freshman 15. Make sure you are careful about your intake. Stay away from fast food, junk food and other terrible choices. These foods are quick and easy, but they are very bad for you. TIP! Eat breakfast before taking a test. Even grabbing a quick snack like a piece of fruit or a cup of yogurt can make a big difference. It is important that you visit a college’s admissions office before committing to a particular school. This will allow you to find out if there are scholarships available that are school specific. Most institutions of higher education offer their student body scholarship opportunities. By checking out your school’s admissions office you can find out what exactly is available to you. TIP! Getting the appropriate amount of sleep at the right times is essential. It is all too easy to stay up all night in college, but getting plenty of sleep is important. You should use the gym on campus; it is free. Both are great ways to get exercise and to meet new people. You can also meet friends with whom you can go to the gym, thereby expanding your social network. TIP! You don’t have anyone cooking and cleaning up after you. Eat healthy and keep everything clean around you. Eat a healthy breakfast before taking a test. Even if you’re short on time, grab a piece of fruit or a cup of yogurt. If you are hungry while taking a test, it is unlikely that you will do well. Eating a good breakfast will prevent you from feeling hungry, boost your energy levels and help you to maintain focus during your test. TIP! You can save some cash by not purchasing your school books until after class has started. Oftentimes, you will not need to purchase all of the “required” books. If you must carry a credit card, make sure you pay the balance monthly. If you only pay the minimum, you will end up with interest and other fees. You should only ever put charges on your card in an emergency. Monitor your spending and keep in mind that your main goal is to get an education. Having to deal with money problems is not helpful. TIP! You should always purchase used books! New textbooks are prohibitively expensive. If you are able to find them used, you will save a lot of money. Look for second-hand textbook deals. Textbooks can be expensive. If you already have to pay quite a bit for your education, you’re probably wishing to save a few dollars. Check out bookstores and online book sellers for used textbooks. Used books are an idea for anyone looking to save a lot of cash. Create good and long lasting friendships with the professors you have. Your professors should be considered as a major resource that will help to open doors to better opportunities. Never be afraid to ask them questions, and help them when you can. Maintaining these good relationships can be advantageous while you are going to college. TIP! High school is much different from college, as you will need to start all over. College is so much different. Beginning college can be an intimidating experience. Through the advice from this article, you can stop the stress and have a nice time in college. Just know you are going to look back on college life fondly.
Maybe it's a nonfiction business book or memoir. Maybe it's a novel or screenplay. Maybe you are not sure. The hardest thing about writing your book, blog or article is NOT imagining what to say. The hard part is the actual writing. Finding the time. Having the confidence. Making it work. I'm not just any ghostwriter. I'm your ghostwriter. Think of me as an extension of yourself. ​I'm the part of you that does the writing, while you go about your day. ​I've been writing for decades. First as a playwright, then as a journalist and editor for daily newspapers. I've also written feature articles for trade magazines that feature products, corporate leaders and unique services. ​These days I'm a ghostwriter who has written books for entrepreneurs, solopreneurs, physicians, therapists, real estate management professionals, chefs, police chiefs and many others. They all came to me with a story to tell. Their story. The story only they could share. A good story can promote a business, an achievement or a glorious episode in your life. I'll help you shape it! I discover who you are and what you wish to express through interviews, and whatever materials you have already created. Maybe notes in a diary, rough sketches, outlines——whatever you have that might be the basis of your book, blog or articles. We create a road map of chapters that will be easy and enjoyable for your audience to follow. They want to know who you are, what matters to you, and why this story is worth their time. Our planning will make the writing process more efficient. That wasn't so hard, was it? I suspect you already have a good idea for a book, because you've been living with it for some time, yet haven't known how to begin. I'll help you launch, because I am your ghostwriter. Tell me about the book or other content you'd like to create.

The Fall classes for HVAC Technology start on Monday, August 15 at 8:15 AM in Building 400, room #460. Please contact Chris Watkins @ 803-778-7886 or Bobby Tyner @ 803-778-6684 Monday thru Thursday between 8AM and 4:30 PM if you have any questions or would like to tour the labs. We look forward to seeing Monday, Have a great week! Check out this incredible light house the HVAC program created to display at Centralbration! The United States Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) tracks over 700 occupations in 300 industries. Their projected growth for these 700 occupations during the time period between 2010 and 2020 is 14.3%. Their projected growth for the HVACR industry during this time period is 34.4%. They estimate that 31.2% of the HVACR industry workforce is baby boomers that will retire during this time and need to be replaced. As 78 million baby boomers retire, there are only 40 million Millennials to replace them. If the HVACR industry can recruit the same proportional share of the workforce as it does today, there will be roughly half as many people to employ as there was in the past. In summary, 65.6% of the people in the HVACR industry in the year 2020 will be people not in the HVACR industry in the year 2010! When Kip Bagley of EMCOR took the stage he said I understand most HVACR programs have more job openings than students to fill. However, did you know that the companies interested in hiring your graduates include: EMCOR, Carrier Commercial, Trane Service, Johnson Controls, Siemens, and McKinstry? Bagley further explained that these companies are just a few of the over 1,400 members of the Mechanical Service Contractors of America (MSCA) looking to fill jobs across the United States. The message was clear, MSCA contractors want to work with HVACR educational programs to fill the positions they have throughout North America. Many of the HVACR jobs going unfilled provide the potential to earn a six digit per year salary, health insurance, pensions, computers, service vehicle, uniforms, lifelong learning opportunities, college credits, certifications, and a career with unlimited opportunity for growth and advancement. Bagley wants to make certain that instructors know of these opportunities to help their students make the best choices for their careers. His goal in attending was to build a partnership between the MSCA member companies and the HVACR educational programs located through the United States and Canada. He encouraged attendees to find a local affiliate by visiting http://www.mcaa.org/directory/local.cfm?s=x. HVACR instructors should reach out to invite local MSCA contractor members to visit their programs, join their advisory boards, and start working together. Mr. Bagley’s presentation, photos and other conference information is available at http://www.hvacexcellence.org/nhetc/Archive/2015/Home.aspx. Instructors are encouraged to visit http://www.mcaa.org/msca/recruiting to learn more about the recruitment and training efforts of the MSCA. For assistance in finding a local contactor member or for any questions, instructors can contact Dania Soto at dsoto@mcaa.org. Contractor members of the Mechanical Service Contractors of America (MSCA) can fast track students to a higher entry level as a result of HVAC Excellence credentials. Learn more. See this story in the Educators Group and share your feedback. Air Flow Test– Thumbs UP! This past Saturday three of our students from the HVAC/R program had the opportunity to make Industry connections with several hundred vendors and HVAC Contractors from all over South Carolina at the annual SCAHACC Convention held at the Grande Dunes Marriot in North Myrtle Beach. These students competed in the “Technician Challenge” where they got to compare their skills with seasoned Technicians from all over the State. They did an excellent job in the challenge and made many contacts with potential employers. Many Thanks to Leigh Faircloth of The South Carolina Association of Heating and Air Conditioning Contractors (SCAHAAC) for allowing our students to participate in this event.
Thread on the skewers (about six on each), oil the grill and when hot, place the prawn skewers on to the grill. Best cooked on an open grill until colour changes to pink. Don't over-cook. Squeeze some lime on top and serve hot along with some mint-coriander yogurt chutney.
It has been a while since I uploaded something to the vault. I found Din's Power is already in the vault but there aren't any Farore's Courage or Nayru's Wisdom bstrm. Here it's one of them. Now only left the Waluigi's Theme!... and all the stages themes. I have included the original one and the Nuts&Bolts version... Personally I prefer the second one!. Here it's one of my favorite Steel-type Pokemon. Note: The rig was made by Tokoyami. Feel free to make recolors and CSPs, only put me in collaborated. For the moment, this is the last pack of my music album from Pokemon Conquest that I would upload to the vault. I know that there are some songs out of this album, like the Dungeon Theme 3, so expect a Pack 5 soon. Note: The preview contains the missing songs in the preview of the pack 1, and two of the songs from the pack 4. Four victory themes to put over the Mario Series Victory or over Game and Watch (with the Paper Mario hack) victory themes. Enjoy!. Note: The preview only shows the Mario's song, but I include the Luigi's, Peach's and Bowser's song in the pack. The Pack 1 of my music album from Pokemon Conquest. Note: The preview contains some songs (not all) of the 17 warlords. The pack 3 of my music album from Pokemon Conquest!. Note: The song in the preview is the Main Theme. This is the pack 4 (Yes, I starting uploading this part because it was the first uploaded to the Download site) of my music album from Pokemon Conquest. It's a great game, but not compared to Black 2 or White 2. Note: The preview only shows the Nobunaga's Ambition Theme. Also, I'm naming a pokemon as "the legendary pokemon" because I don't want to spoil anyone who will play the game in the future. The other three packs will be uploaded soon. The first song that you heard when you play Paper Mario TTYD!. It's one of my favorite songs in all the game and I'm sharing it with you. I can't find a better one (The sound of the pages of the book are in the bstrm). Second theme of Mario Galaxy uploaded from me. This time it's Purple Coins, the music that plays when you play on a galaxy with the purple comet around. One Hundred Purple Coins... Here I go!. All the colors used for this pack were extracted of the original part's color of the characters used in Mecha Ganon (Except for Ganon's hair, and Bowser's Shell in the Black recolor). I'm surprised no one uploaded a song of this awesome serie. It's the Opening 1 of Tiger&Bunny played on a synthesizer. Credit to pikazz for the model. Thanks to THE Sonic Wolf for the preview!.

South African prisoners have access to communication devices that include: sim cards, chargers and DSTV walkers, and the DA is calling for the state to put signal jamming devices in prisons. This emerged from a reply to a DA parliamentary question from the Minister of Correctional Services, Mike Masutha, who revealed that the department is losing the battle against crime in prisons. The ministry has confiscated 98 413 illegal communication devices from inside prisons in the past five years. It said of the 98 413 devices, a total of 64 123 cellular devices have been confiscated from remand detainees and convicted prisoners. Other communication devices include: sim cards, chargers and DSTV walkers devices. “The use of illegal communications devices in prisons makes detention facilities conduits for the direct coordination of crimes in communities, particularly gang activity,” says James Selfe, chairperson of DA Federal Council and Shadow Minister of Correctional Services. While the eventual detection of these devices is laudable, Selfe said the prevention is always better than cure – prison officials are clearly failing in this respect as well. “I will therefore write to Minister Masutha to request that he accelerate the procurement of signal jamming devices to be placed in each and every prison in our country. Convicted inmates make use of these communication devices to handle smuggled goods and direct their criminal activities outside our prisons,” said Selfe. Selfe said: “If we can use signal jammers in Parliament why not in Pollsmoor”?

It’s not easy caring for an infant or toddler with type 1 diabetes since they cannot communicate verbally about how they’re feeling. The following tips for managing diabetes in infants and toddlers, from the Diabetes Research Institute, are offered to make the experience less anxiety provoking for child and parent. Although we don’t want to cause our children distress, never sneak up on them with self blood glucose monitoring (SBGM) or insulin injections. Doing this may teach children to be wary any time a parent approaches them. Calmly state your intentions and talk your child through these procedures. To minimize SBGM discomfort, use the child’s less sensitive heels instead of their tender fingers. When possible, allow toddlers to assist with SBGM and insulin injections. You might, for instance, let them pick the site for an injection, or a glucose check. Setting up a “diabetes station” in your home for glucose checks and injections is a good idea, but do not make it at or near the child’s bed. Their bed should remain a comfort zone. If the insulin injections seem to be painful, review your technique with the health care team. Utilizing ice, a numbing cream, or a device such as “inject ease” might be recommended to minimize discomfort. Know the required amount and kind of foods/fluids to treat blood sugar lows; for infants and toddlers this might be as little as five to ten grams of carbs (whatever your doctor recommends). Oral syringes work well for delivering syrupy fluids. If a child is unconscious, never give him or her anything by mouth; turn the child on their side and call 911. Behavior changes are often the first sign of glucose changes (usually a low) so check blood sugar levels when they act out of sorts. Other low glucose indicators are sweating, shaking, a particular cry, and out of the ordinary unsteadiness. Indications of high blood sugar are an increase in the frequency of fussiness, sleepiness, infections, and diaper changes. Keep in mind that blood sugar levels go down with increased activity. Busy toddlers may need additional carbs during active periods of their day. Do not use food to reward your child; instead use extra play time, stickers, toys, hugs, and kisses. During an illness there is increased risk for glucose elevation, so check your infant’s and toddler’s blood sugar more often when they are sick. Encourage them to drink fluids, and be on the lookout for signs of dehydration (e.g., fewer wet diapers, dry looking mouth). Make sure you have an accessible diabetes care team in place to answer any questions and address your concerns. To prevent the responsibility from falling on one person, it is preferable to get all family members involved in your child’s diabetes care. Be sure to get the support you need by sharing your anxious thoughts and feelings with friends, family members, or your health care team, and consider joining on online or in-person support group. Though it likely goes without saying, never make a change in your child’s prescribed diabetes treatment routine (e.g., glucose monitoring, insulin administration) before talking it over with your physician.
It is being reported that Unalaska's historic Cathedral of the Ascension has been desecrated by vandals who spray-painted "Dutch" and "Duncha" on the outside of the Alaskan Orthodox house of worship. Local Alaskan authorities have pledged to catch the perpetrator or perpetrators of the crime, which is both a federal offense (as the cathedral is a historic landmark) and possibly a hate crime.

How Do I Know If My Kids Need Orthodontic Braces? Deciding whether your child needs braces or not is easier with the help of your general dentist or a qualified orthodontist. If your child has severely crooked teeth or has other serious problems that could interfere with his or her ability to eat and speak properly, the decision to wear braces can be a life-changing event. If only minor cosmetic flaws are present, you may wish to weigh the pros and cons. To find pediatric orthodontists in Miami who are highly rated, ask your family dentist, your friends and neighbors, and others about their experiences.

Power rangers, like pokemon, will never grow old, they shall both always be classics. If she was unimpressed by power rangers, shes not worth your time. This is why guys can't find a gf. They run into all the girls that are terrified and so turned off by cool things like Power Rangers. It would actually bother me more if she was turned off from quoting Pokemon. I am pretty sure little kids won't know what IVs or EVs are and whether or not their Pokemon is physical or special...and if the move is physical or special. At 54, I'm not a little kid and when I play pokemon I don't pay attention to any of those things. I play pokemon because pokemon. I grew up with Pokemon and power rangers. I don't even like any of them. That's what happens when you make assumptions. You give Mario a bad name! That's when you say "My friend dared me." ^ I heard Goldar was there, and said "do an impression of me, NOW!" Haven't we all done silly things thinking we're alone. Unfortunately, he wasn't, but it would have still qualified as FML if he was still alone. When you feel like youre alone, you never are. Especially if your working and/or its night. Unless you're the boss, or the only person who locks up assume you aren't alone! 7- You used "you're" correctly the first time - albeit without the apostrophe, yet you fouled it up the second time? You have heard of such things called typos right? You should meet my boss he watches Power Rangers every shift ! Sounds like she's not worth it then. Maybe she'll be your pink ranger. She is obviously Rita. You need to be Lord Zedd in order to get her.

It’s not a new idea to wonder how the birth of Jesus would have occurred in modern-day Britain, what is new is to approach that question with humour, quick wit and some subtle seriousness. Timothy Blore’s one-hour production is a re-telling of the nativity story where year zero Bethlehem is swapped for 2018 Billericay (think “there’s no room at the inn, the Holiday Inn”) and, whilst it consists almost entirely of nose-tapping references and snappy one-liners, does manage to land as a substantive critique of the moralising upper middle class of this country. We open with a family of four playing Trivial Pursuit and a sharpened script driving a worryingly accurate portrayal of a mid-life Christmas with grown-ish children. Banter flies across the board as Linda and Michael (Gillian King and Chris Pickles) lead their family in what many in the young audience would recognise as a harrowingly accurate portrayal of being simultaneously berated with and embarrassed by your parents’ experience, knowledge and lifestyle. Matthew (Jack Forsyth Noble) and Luke (Jonathan Savage) are recognisable but not stereotyped; they are young men looking to establish themselves without actually rebelling against their life of plenty. The payload of the show is delivered in the last half an hour as Maria (Bella Nash) and Joe (Clemente Lohr) arrived after being made homeless, and ask if they can sleep inside, only to be placed in the shed. A serious theme is smuggled to the audience inside the banter and references, giving the solid foundation necessary for the joking not to seem frivolous and self-aggrandising. But the message is simple and summed up most memorably with “you must live on cloud Corbyn if you think we’re going to let a couple of gypos stay”. A great script was delivered well by the entire cast ably directed by Scott le Crass. The rehearsal and thought that had clearly gone into the show led to both clarity and great amusement. At times the piece serves the clever references of the writer, not the other way around but it’s hard to care when there is such fun and wit scattered throughout. Ultimately, Alternativity is a clever little show full of disguised thoughtfulness which lands with tight performances and commitment on stage and off.
Recently, President Obama submitted a foreign assistance spending plan to Congress, requesting nearly 38 billion dollars in funding. To which countries, though, is America sending the most money? According to foreignassistance.gov, the nation of Israel receives the lion's share of foreign aid, approximately 3.1 billion dollars. Enjoying Low Oil Prices? These Countries Aren't.

The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) was passed in 2002 in response to the voting discrepencies exposed in the 2000 presidential election. HAVA imposes a number of requirements on states, with the stated purpose of bringing voting practices in the separate states and precincts to a national standard. HAVA requires that all states upgrade their voting systems. Many precincts in 2000 were still using lever and punch card voting systems. The new legislation mandates that these machines be replaced immediately and sets aside federal funding for that purpose. All precincts are required to upgrade to electronic voting devices. Critics of the bill are concerned by this statement, believing that electronic voting machines were part of the problem in 2000. Human Services will pay the state’s protection and advocacy system to “ensure full participation in the electoral process” for disabled individuals including registering to vote, casting a vote, and accessing polling places. In response to the confusions in the 2000 elections, HAVA requires that all voting machines tell voters whom they have selected to cast their ballots for, and give them the opportunity to change their votes if an error has occurred. HAVA proclaims that if a voter shows up a to a polling place is not on the list of registered voters, they have the right to cast a provisional ballot. The government will determine whether they are truly registered or not at a later date. The act also requires that military personnel be provided with voter registration forms, absentee ballots, and election information. HAVA sets in place several national requirements pertaining to voter registration. First, when registering, all citizens must provide either a valid driver’s license or the last four digits of their social security number when registering to vote in a federal election. Second, all voters must provide either a valid driver’s license, the last four digits of their social security number, a valid photo ID, copy of current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck or other government document that shows the name and address of the voter either with their registration or when they vote. Finally, HAVA contains clauses providing for the enforcement of its provisions. The Attorney General has the right to bring civil action against any State or locality as he/she deems necessary for the enforcement of the uniform and non-discriminatory requirements of the bill. In addition any state receiving any of the federal funding provided by the bill must establish an administrative complaint process for citizens to file their complaints. The state must review all complaints, but can dismiss a complaint if they feel it is unfounded.

The smell of a campfire, roasting marshmallows and sleeping under the starts can be an unforgettable summer experience for children of any age. Boredom during summer break typically leads to boredom after only a few weeks, but if there are time restraints or if it’s not in the budget for a family camping trip, a backyard camping trip is the perfect solution to having a family adventure close to home. Camping is a fun experience and even in your backyard, the sounds and sights are different during the night. Backyard camping is a great way to introduce the kids to the experience of camping including how the sights and sounds change at night, cooking over an open fire and telling scary stories with only the light from a lantern, all of the camping experiences, without leaving the comforts of home. Prepare for the camping trip as though the family is going camping in an actual campground. Pack everything that you would typically take when camping including the tents, food items, supplies and activities. Carry all items out to the backyard and make it a “rule” that unless it is for a bathroom break, family members are not to enter the house. If you forget items, turn the adventure into an experience just like on an actual camping trip and make do with the items you have. After carrying all supplies out to the backyard, it is time to set-up the campsite. Getting everything ready for the adventure is part of the camping fun. Find a good place to pitch the tent, such as near the side of the house or in the furthest back corner away from the house. The area should be flat and free from tree roots or stones, but the further away from the house you set up camp; the more it will feel as though you are out of the backyard. Encourage the kids to help with the tent set-up and if you have a separate tent for the kids, let them set their own tent up. Although, a comforter and fluffy pillow will be more comfortable, for the full camping effect it is best to use sleeping bags or inflatable mattress. The optimum way to have a successful backyard camping trip is to have an open fire; however, if your city ordinances do not allow a fire pit, a small charcoal grill will be the next best thing. A gas grill is nice, however, it will not allow you to have the full camping experience of sitting around a fire telling stories or roasting marshmallows. Position the grill away from the campsite, and have plenty of charcoal on hand to keep the fire going. Eat foods that you would typically eat on a camping trip such as hot dogs and hamburgers and don’t forget the graham crackers, chocolate and marshmallows for the S’Mores. The games played on a camping trip are part of what makes the experience memorable for kids. Play games such as flashlight tag. To play flashlight tag, the person who is “it” uses the beam of a flashlight to tag the others as they run around the yard and try to avoid getting tagged with the beam. Have a family concert by giving the kids ten minutes to search the yard and find items that can be used to make music and sit around the fire playing the instruments and singing songs. Just before bedtime, sit around the fire and tell ghost stories, remember to keep the stories only slightly scary if you have small children who may scare easily. After settling in the tents for the night, put a movie in either a portable DVD player or run an outdoor safe extension cord to a small television and DVD player in the tent. Watch a funny family movie and eat popcorn that was cooked on the fire before going to sleep for the night. Joan McCray is a travel writer living in NYC.

Maralynne D. Mitcham, Carol J. Lancaster, Beth M. Stone; Evaluating the Effectiveness of Occupational Therapy Faculty Development Workshops. Am J Occup Ther 2002;56(3):335-339. doi: 10.5014/ajot.56.3.335. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate, from the participants’ perspective, the effectiveness over time of 10 occupational therapy faculty development workshops conducted between 1994 and 1998. METHOD. Surveys were mailed to 179 occupational therapy faculty participants to gather demographic data and perceptions of the following aspects of the workshops: benefits over time of the instructional content, changes made in current teaching practices, progress as a faculty member, and future needs for faculty development. RESULTS. The response rate was 63% (n = 106). The majority (72%) of respondents had less than 5 years of teaching experience. Respondents were women in their early 40s with approximately 12 years of clinical experience and a master’s degree. Respondents perceived the most effective aspect of the faculty development workshops as the opportunity to participate in a face-to-face environment in which they observed the skills of a master teacher demonstrating instructional principles. Further, respondents reported that the greatest changes in their current teaching practices occurred in their ability to design, implement, and evaluate a course of instruction, thus increasing their perceptions of progress as a faculty member. CONCLUSION. The 10 faculty development workshops conducted between 1994 and 1998 were judged effective by occupational therapy faculty members who perceived that their participation resulted in benefits over time to their current teaching practices.
Our Senior Adult Ministry Team is a fellowship of visionary Christian leaders and vital Christian friends who celebrate the season of our senior years with vitality and vision for our future. The Board of Laity of our Oklahoma Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church awarded our Senior Adult Ministry with the "It Worked For Us!" Award at our Annual Conference on May 31, 2005. This new Conference award was given to only one church in each of the 12 districts in honor of that church's leadership in designing and developing a new laity lead ministry in 2005. Lindsay United Methodist was the recipient for the Ardmore District recognition through the leadership of our Senior Adult Ministry, coordinated by Mrs. Leo (June) Elkins, and our United Methodist Men & United Methodist Youth leaders in the establishment of "The 4th Quarter Club" (special recognition ministry, spring banquet and fellowship activities for Senior Adults 75 years and older) and for the "Kairos Team" Ministry which provides support, care and assistance to our senior adults who require assistance with some minor home repair needs, the changing of batteries for smoke alarms and seasonal cleanup around their homes during the time of the "Time Change" (April & October each year). These new Senior Adult Ministry programs connected to our other senior adult fellowship gatherings throughout the year seek to offer the care and support for our senior adults in this season of life.
These are my favorite history resources to use in class (and at home)! We use these history sentence cards in my class, and they've been a hit! The kids can see what the people look like, mix up the cards and put them back in order, etc. I usually will hand each child a card and have them hold it up as we sing the history song together. I'll be updating all the Tutor Talk pages as the year progresses.

TAUNTON – It took nearly two years, but police said they have DNA proof that a city woman broke into a camper trailer being stored at a self-storage facility. Police say Kerri Machnik, 46, formerly of Main Street, will be summoned into district court to face charges of breaking and entering into a trailer; malicious destruction of property under $1,200; and larceny of less than $1,200. Police say it wasn’t until this month that they received confirmation from a Plymouth County assistant district attorney that DNA taken from the crime scene matched that of Machnik. Machnik in August 2017 allegedly broke into a camper trailer parked on the fenced-in grounds of Compass Self Storage at 33 Chandler Ave. Police said they observed droplets of blood on the camper’s floor and blood smears from fingerprints. Samples of blood and fingerprints were processed by a Plymouth County Sherriff’s officer, who police say works with that sheriff department’s Bureau of Criminal Investigations. Items listed as stolen included a Vizio flat-screen TV, a large camping gazebo and all food. Police said when they met with him last week at his Wales Street home, the victim did not recognize Machnik from a prior booking photo, nor did he know her name. Police say Machnik has 46 prior adult court arraignments in her criminal file. Machnik was the subject of a 2014 Taunton Daily Gazette story after she and a city man were arrested for malicious destruction of property. The couple allegedly caused more than $1,100 in damage to an apartment building at 61 Main St. after being informed that they were being evicted. Cleveland-based Compass Self Storage, according to its website, has facilities in 14 states.
Across much of the developing world one of the most stubbornly persistent signs of gender inequality is the low rate of land ownership among women. The situation is particularly dire in sub-Saharan Africa: estimates vary, but recent work by Cheryl Doss and her co-authors suggest that roughly 20-30 percent of landowners across the continent are women. These deep inequalities in land ownership appear to hold in urban Tanzania as well, where nearly 75 percent of all land is registered under a single male name. This entry was posted on Tuesday, 15 July 2014 by Jorge Carrillo in Gender and tagged land, property rights, women.
What is the best way, how you can find some referrals who will help you to promote one page and find new referrals? Do you mean referrals as in affiliates? It depends if your product is unique or if you are an affiliate for another company in which case you need to make sure yo stand out by offering your team something different. The best way to get others to promote your stuff is to make it as easy as possible for them to do it. It would also depend on the industry as to where you might find referrals. Forums will work better than social networks in this case, I would recommend finding relevant forums to your niche and advertising your services or asking members to join your program. In order to get the referrals, you need to offer some compensation to them to encourage them refer others to your page/offer. Usually it's revenue share scheme. The best way is to pay second third tier referrals so it all depends if your looking to get others to promote your services. With first or second tier your paying your referral for each subsription and their referrers that promote your affiliate program. What do you offer for webmaster referrals? What is one page your landing page? Do you want affiliates or webmaster referrals? I am looking for programs that offer referral incentives as i have type in domains. Can I have multiple AdSense accounts? Some creative ideas about crafts promoting? Referral exclusion list not working!

Apparently the EL and Fedora world has been using SELinux for 10 years now. It also made it in Debian. We are celebrating the SELinux 10th year anversary this year. Hard to believe it. SELinux was first introduced in Fedora Core 3 and later in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4. SElinux is a labeling system. Every process has a label. Every file/directory object in the operating system has a label. Even network ports, devices, and potentially hostnames have labels assigned to them. We write rules to control the access of a process label to an a object label like a file. We call this policy. The kernel enforces the rules. Sometimes this enforcement is called Mandatory Access Control (MAC). The owner of an object does not have discretion over the security attributes of a object. Standard Linux access control, owner/group + permission flags like rwx, is often called Discretionary Access Control (DAC). SELinux has no concept of UID or ownership of files. Everything is controlled by the labels. Meaning an SELinux system can be setup without an all powerful root process.

Madison — The speed limit on some Wisconsin highways would rise to 70 mph, under a proposal approved by the state Senate on a voice vote Wednesday. The bill would end Wisconsin's status as a lone island of 65 mph limits in the Midwest by increasing the maximum speed on stretches of interstates and some other four-lane highways that have overpasses, underpasses and ramps instead of other roads that directly cross traffic on the highway. The proposal now returns to the Assembly, which passed a different version on a bipartisan vote in March. The bill would mean that stretches of all interstates in Wisconsin could be marked up to 70 mph by Gov. Scott Walker's administration, as could stretches of state Highways 51, 53 and 151. The proposal's lead sponsor in the Senate, Republican Devin LeMahieu of Oostburg, called it "common sense legislation" that left a final decision on the speed limits up to state transportation officials. "This legislation authorizes, but does not require, the Department of Transportation to raise the speed limit on interstates and freeways where it is safe to do so," LeMahieu said. All of Wisconsin's neighbors have maximum speed limits of 70 mph or higher, and Wisconsin is the only state between Pennsylvania and Oregon that doesn't have a maximum speed limit of at least 70 mph. So far, Walker hasn't said whether he would sign the bill and the state DOT has not said how much time it would take to determine which highway stretches could rise to 70 mph and then change their signs accordingly. Spokeswomen for Walker and the DOT had no further comment on the Senate action beyond saying that their offices are monitoring the legislation. Until now, opponents have blocked the proposal's passage in Wisconsin by arguing that there would be inevitable safety effects from allowing the higher speeds. But a compromise among GOP lawmakers cleared the way for the proposal to move forward by ensuring that highways with at-grade crossings for intersecting roads or even driveways couldn't be cleared for 70 mph speeds. AAA Wisconsin has argued that the speed limit should not be changed in Wisconsin, particularly for heavy trucks, because an increase of 5 mph could lengthen the stopping distance for those vehicles by as much as 100 feet, or 20%. The motorists group cites federal data showing that large trucks were involved in 7.4% of fatal crashes in Wisconsin in 2012, while Minnesota and Iowa — which allow trucks to travel 70 mph on rural highways — had rates of 10% and 13.2%, respectively. Democrats such as Rep. Dan Riemer of Milwaukee have said that they won't vote for the bill until they see strong evidence that it won't make the state's roads more dangerous, arguing that the proposal's supporters owe that to the public. ■Broaden existing state law to make it a felony to physically harm or threaten to harm a current or former law enforcement officer, prosecutor or judge because of an official action taken by those authorities or their colleagues. The proposal goes to the Assembly. ■Allow search warrants to be issued so that blood can be drawn for testing from a driver who is suspected of a first-time intoxicated driving offense. Under U.S. Supreme Court rulings, a failure to get a search warrant for a blood draw could affect a criminal case if the driver didn't agree to the test first. But in Wisconsin, it's not possible currently to get a search warrant in first-time drunken driving cases. That's because search warrants are issued only in criminal investigations and Wisconsin is the only state in the nation in which first offense drunken driving on its own is a municipal violation, similar to a speeding ticket, and not a crime. In approving the measure on a voice vote, the Senate sent it to the Assembly. ■Make it a crime for a person to falsely claim that he or she received military honors in the absence of such awards. The Assembly will take the proposal up next. ■Make it a misdemeanor to put a global positioning device on people or their vehicle without their consent. There would be exemptions for law enforcement; parents and guardians using the devices to track their minor children; businesses that monitor where their vehicles go; and lien holders who use the devices to find vehicles for repossession. The Senate passed the measure on a voice vote Wednesday. The Assembly approved it in February.
The NO-MELT carbide-tipped saw blade is especially designed for cutting single or multiple stacked sheets of plastic without chipping or melting these materials. NO-MELT blades are particularly suitable for acrylics, delrins, ABS, styrenes, PVC, and both high and low melt nylons. Specially engineered side clearances on the carbide teeth significantly reduced and in many cases, totally eliminate any formation of melted burrs or buildup of residue on cross-sawn sections or plastic materials. The large number of carbide teeth with a special modified triple-chip-grind (#11 tooth style) allows fast feeding of brittle acrylics with no chipping. On table saw, raise blade to cut cooler, lower blade to prevent chipping.
The nonprofit that has run the recently shuttered National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) for 20 years plans to replace the website and run it privately. The initial site will enable users to search and retrieve ECRI’s summarizations of clinical practice guidelines from hundreds of participating guideline developers and will include unbiased evaluations on the rigor and transparency of guidelines against the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine) standards for trustworthiness, according to ECRI. The second phase will feature advanced search capabilities, support for guideline implementation and decision-making, and an enhanced user interface. Participating guideline developers will be able to access and contribute to the website free of charge. Annual funding for the NGC was approximately $2.1 million in FY 2015-FY 2016. In FY 2017, funding was reduced to $1.2 million. The site attracted about 200,000 monthly visits. The costs to establish a private guidelines site will reflect labor, website build and copyright fees, according to ECRI spokeswoman Laurie Menyo. The government-funded site was free and open to the public. ECRI will develop its pricing strategy over the rest of the summer, and plans to keep the cost reasonable, Menyo said. “We intend to set up a membership service with a variety of subscription options,” she added. The original partnership among AHRQ, the American Medical Association and the American Association of Health Plans (now America’s Health Insurance Plans) to fund NGC ended in 2002, according to the federal agency. ECRI’s new guideline website “will provide a centralized repository of current, properly vetted evidence-based clinical practice guideline summaries and information,” the organization said in a statement. Plymouth Meeting, Penn.-based ECRI is a nonprofit dedicated to analyzing and researching which medical procedures, devices, drugs and processes are best to improve patient care, the group said. A similar AHRQ online database, the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse,(www.qualitymeasures.ahrq.gov) also shut down this week. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services supported that site’s funding for the last two years. AHRQ is providing direct access to CMS’ quality measures content at CMS Measures. News that the government planned to shut down NGC caused an uproar in medical circles.

drifts in hues of memory. Poetry is a recently acquired… oh, let’s not call it obsession but rather… interest for me. Reading it has allowed me to serve up a dose of the evocative in my normally quiet and routine daily life. As for writing it, well, that serves two purposes: it’s given me an outlet for those short sharp bursts of either inspiration or emotion that seem intent on elbowing their way to the front of my consciousness and it’s slowly influencing my long-form writing which is often too verbose and frequently contains repetitive elements. Yesterday, my attention was caught by a phrase that went something like “…[it] washed over them in a heavy wave and [she] felt it draw something back with it…” and was struck by how well that expressed a large part of how my logical brain perceives creative inspiration. Unfortunately, only once has the experience been even close to that dramatic with the outcome a piece written almost whole cloth and seemingly with little-to-no conscious input. I’m very much a construction worker when it comes to writing. I usually have a flash that forms the foundation but after that it’s board-by-board methodical labor. I was divided in where I thought this poem was going. My initial understanding was that I was going to write about “the muse” and I did write a piece along those lines but it wasn’t quite clicking into place. When that happens I’ll strip a poem back down to its core elements and see what else can be built of it. The rewrite wasn’t wholly successful because I ended up frustrated that it repeated thematic elements I seem to be stuck on recently but it rang truer than my initial attempt so now I’ll let it rest for a while until I decide whether to let it stand or tear it back down again.

The Tangle Quartet contains four high-quality linear, bleed-free VCAs with low distortion and low noise. Besides that the module has a mix function for those channels whose individual outputs are not in use, becoming a voltage controlled mixer. The four linear VCAs are built around THAT 2164 VCA-ICs which show low distortion and noise and are free of bleed-thru. The four channels are DC coupled and are suitable for processing both audio and CVs.

Health Clubs at Home prove that you don’t need to be part of a professional gym to get professional treatment. The gym equipment experts are helping people see that the revolution starts at home with a huge range of new and used commercial Treadmills for sale. Commercial Treadmills offer many benefits over machines designed for home use. The benefits of working out at home are clear. Less self-conscious, more willing to work up a sweat and the ability to jump right in. So why not mix this with commercial equipment, such as Treadmills, as part of your home gym set up? Doing this makes the perfect stage for a successful and stress free home workout. Managing Director Howard Braband has created the platform that can make this possible. For 10 years his award winning company has offered people the chance to work out from home. This is with a range of both new and refurbished commercial fitness equipment. Everyone will have different tastes when it comes to Treadmills. It is safe to say that Health Clubs at Home can cater for all of those needs. Whether it is style or a certain function that is the most important. Howard Braband also comments; ‘We are able to offer customers some top of the range machines, such as the Precor Treadmills. All of this is done at a very affordable rate. Meaning customers will pay a fraction for the gym equipment that the commercial gyms did, sometimes only just over a year before. As well as single machines there are fantastic offers available. Such as the garage package which includes a Treadmill, Bike and Rowing Machine. All this means that fitness enthusiasts can have a mini commercial gym in the garage, for the equivalent price of one machine. That’s not to say that Health Clubs at Home are limited in their selection. There are several brands on offer to customers, all offering something a little different. In the same way why not try something new in the home? There are wide ranges of Elliptical Cross Trainers that are perfect for a smaller room and easily utilised in spare time. Health Clubs at Home are all about offering customers more than just a Treadmill. A new blog creates a platform for people to get involved, and is available to anyone looking for advice or wanting to share their fitness stories. By sharing health tips and workout plans, check it out now at http://www.healthclubsathome.blogspot.com.

The coming end of summer brings the return to school. Over the last week or so, I’ve already seen dozens of ‘first day of school’ pictures. Most of these photos have children standing on the front steps holding their new, freshly stocked backpacks or a sign indicating that this is the day of firsts. I have also seen photos of teachers proclaiming their joy to return to the classroom. For every ‘first day’, there is also a ‘last day.’ The first day of kindergarten, for example, signifies the end of a key phase of life for both the child and the parents.. a phase in which they had grown comfortable and confident. It means that the child is leaving behind something precious and special for something else that promises to be new and exciting, though, perhaps, a bit intimidating. In these ‘first day of school’ photos, you can almost see a sense of anxiety mixed with the anticipation. Starting something new is like that… anticipation, anxiety, excitement with a dash of fear or hesitation mixed in. We experience many ‘first days’ throughout our lives… first day in a new job, first day in a new city, first day married, first day alone, first day as a parent, first day retired… Most of us just go with the flow regarding firsts. However, there are times when some forethought and planning would help us cope or prosper during these times of transition. There are also times when individuals work feverishly to avoid a ‘first day.’ They either fear the unknown of a new chapter or they have become so comfortable where they are that they simply would rather take the risk of settling for their current situation than taking a step into the unknown. For example, I have known many individuals that have clearly reached a dead end in their career. Yet, they can’t or won’t take a step to explore new possibilities or new opportunities. By staying “comfortable”, they forfeit challenges, new relationships, and career advancement (including financial gain). As a parent, we tell our fearful kindergartner that school will be fun and exciting and they will make new friends and learn so many new things. But, often, those same parents will continue going to the same dreadful job, doing the same things, because they are afraid to look at new opportunities themselves. I have learned that there are three primary questions that you need to ask whenever you face or are contemplating a new ‘first day.’ By spending some time asking – and answering – these questions you can be better prepared for that next chapter that you face. Will I reach my potential if I do not make a change? Will I reach my life goals (financial, work\life) if I stay? What will I be doing in 5 years? What are the risks and benefits of your own ‘first day’? – Whether you know it or admit it or not, we all are risk managers. We mitigate an automobile accident by buckling our seat belts. We exercise caution when cleaning the gutters. We protect our children. In the same way, we exercise caution around ‘big changes’ in our lives. When faced with a big decision about your next potential ‘first day’, do a formal risk\benefit analysis… write it down! Often, this activity can make it clear what you need to do next. What happens if you don’t make a change? What is the best case and worst case scenario if you do make a change? How will your life be different a year from now if you do make a change? Or, if you don’t? Is you fear or hesitancy based on facts or emotions? What will I need to help me take that step toward a ‘first day’? – If you think a new direction or ‘first day’ is needed for you, what steps should you take now? Be brave – Just like you might tell your new kindergartner, be courageous. There is nothing to fear. This is a new adventure. Good things are coming. Get prepared – For a career change, do your research. What is your logical next career step? What skills do you want to highlight? What are your target companies? Who, in your network, do you need to speak with? Focus on the facts – Eliminate the emotions that can drive your anxiety and give rise to second thoughts. Focus on where you want to be, what you want to do, and what steps are needed today. Don’t linger too much on the past and the good times you’ve experienced. Keep things in balance. Remember other ‘first days’ in your life – You have done this before. You’ve gone through other ‘first days’ and they have been blessings in your life. Sometimes in life, we just need to charge ahead with something new, something different. But at other times, we are not given a choice. The questions outlined above can even help with ‘forced transitions.’ Though it may be very difficult looking ahead in challenging times, we need to think about what’s next. How can you make the very best of the days, weeks, and months ahead? Recognize that leaving some things behind is very difficult, but that you can make the best of what lies ahead.

In 1989, she was a Christian homemaker and college professor with a Doctorate in Linguistics in northern India. Like all Indians she saw poverty in the streets everyday of her life. One fateful day, God decided to use her to change hearts of children in a slum of 25,000 people across from her apartment. After teaching more than 100 children from her home, Ananthi received permission to establish a school within the “toilet complex” of the Alakananda slum in 1991. By 1998, she was teaching more than 600 children of all ages within the slum community with the help of 18 volunteer teachers. With a passion for these children, Ananthi manages a staff of over 150 in New Delhi, India. The children and families of the communities call her “Mummy-ji” which in Hindi means “honored mother”.

"This bracket has been discontinued by Peerless and is no longer available." The PEWV250 offers the most movement possible in Peerless's range. It has a double articulated arm which simply means you can put your TV in virtually any position possible. The entire mechanism folds to only 8.4 cm so when you want to push the TV out of the way it won't take up much room. However, when out you'll be able to easily place it exactly where you want it. The two arms allow virtually any position within a 180 degree arc of your wall up to a distance of 51 cm from the wall. The TV can also be turned left or right by a further 90 degrees, or even tilted and rolled. You'll struggle to find any limitation within that arc.
A rich layered cake that is topped and coated with chocolate ganache. It is a complete pleasure to bake these cakes and can be served as a sinful dessert along with a nice cup of tea or coffee. You can also serve them as your Party dessert. The Devils Food Cake Recipe is nothing but a rich dark layered chocolate cake, that is topped and coated with chocolate ganache. The cake is made with rich cocoa and with a rich Chocolate Ganache, is sure to tingle your senses. The devils food cake is for those pure chocolate lovers who can enjoy it over a hot cup of coffee or tea or serve it as a dessert for parties. I have shared how to make this cake egg free (eggless) as well using the Flax Meal Egg Replacer. To begin making the Rich Dark Devil's Food Cake Recipe, we will first preheat the oven to 180 C. Grease and flour 2 - 8 inch cake round cake pans. Keep aside. If your recipe asks for 3 eggs, measure 3 tablespoons of flax meal along with 9 tablespoons of water. Stir well and let the mixture rest for about 15 minutes. This process of resting helps the flax meal mixture develop a gelatinous consistency similar to eggs. Sift the flour, baking powder, salt and cocoa powder and keep aside. Gradually add in the butter milk and food coloring. And finally, gradually fold in the flour mixture and continue to fold until the mixture is well blended and smooth. Divide the chocolate cake batter into 2 greased baking pans and place in the preheated oven to bake for about 35 to 45 minutes, until a tester when inserted in the center comes out clean. Once the cakes are baked, remove them from the oven and cool them completely. While the cake is cooling, prepare the Chocolate Ganache recipe. Place one cake on the serving tray in which you plan to set the cake. Spread a generous portion of the chocolate ganache on the top of the cake. Place the other cake over the bottom one and lightly press down. Finally cover the whole cake with the Chocolate Ganache including the sides and the top. Refrigerate the cake for at least 4 to 5 hours. Serve the Rich Dark Chocolate Devils Food Cake along with a cup of coffee or as a dessert for parties.

A baby in a neonatal intensive-care unit turned a deep blue-black. A nurse had the courage to defy the medical team and insist that the heart monitor was wrong. The baby’s heart wasn’t beating. It had a pneumopericardium, a condition where the sac around the heart fills with air and prevents it from beating. She saved the baby’s life. People who repair photocopiers swap stories about problems that they have seen on the job and how they solved them. The stories help coworkers think about how they would have dealt with the situation. Used in this way, stories “are like flight simulators for the brain,” according to Made to Stick. “Hearing the nurse’s heart-monitor story isn’t like being there, but it’s the next best thing.” The story provides important context and details. The challenge plot. Think David and Goliath. It’s “the underdog story, the rags-to-riches story, the triumph of sheer willpower over adversity.” The obstacles seem daunting. These stories inspire us to try harder, defy the odds, to take action. The book tells the story of a college student named Jared who lost 245 pounds by eating at Subway (and exercising once his health permitted). His story was so sticky that it ended up on USA Today, ABC and Oprah. The connection plot. Think the Good Samaritan. He helped someone he didn’t know, who wasn’t part of his social group. Connection plots can also be romance stories, like Romeo and Juliet. Connection plots are about how we relate to other people. The creativity plot. Think the apple that falls on Newton’s head. In the creativity plot, someone solves a difficult puzzle or takes an innovative approach to a problem. Creativity plots inspire us to be creative, to try new approaches. Think MacGyver. Pay attention. Make it unexpected. Understand and remember it. Make it concrete. Agree or believe. Make it credible. Care about it. Make it emotional. Be able to act on it. Tell a story. This is the last of several posts about Made to Stick, by Chip Heath and Dan Heath.

Finger Lakes Distilling out of upstate New York is known in craft whiskey circles for a number of reasons, including that they set up shop in an area more well known for wine then whiskey production and also that they have been making brown spirit for a decade now. Add as well to this list now that they have a bottled in bond bourbon. The new McKenzie Bottled-in-Bond Wheated Bourbon, according to those behind it, meets the strict requirements of the Bottled-in-Bond Act: the product of a single distillery from a single distilling season, aged a minimum of four years, and bottled at 100 proof or 50% alcohol by volume. It is distilled from mash bill of local corn (70%), red winter wheat (20%), and malted barley (10%). This new bourbon joins the distillery’s straight rye, straight bourbon (rye recipe) and pot still whiskeys. Bottled at 100 proof, it is pricing for $43 and will initially be available in the distillery’s tasting room as well as select retailers in New York, New Jersey, California, Nevada and Arizona.
In 1980 there was considerable confusion surrounding the management of osteosarcoma. Those involved in the management of this disease were faced with a series of conflicts. The early promise of chemotherapy as initially reported by Jaffe appeared to have been logically extended by Rosen in a series of studies culminating in the startling results of T10 wherein over 90% of patients were disease free at 2 years. However, the use of chemotherapy in Europe was producing surprisingly little improvement in survival over that achieved by amputation alone. Both the E.O.R.T.C. Studies and that undertaken by the Medical Research Council (M.R.C.) in the United Kingdom were disappointing, although in retrospect it is clear that the intensity of chemotherapy was inadequate [1,2]. At the same time the Mayo Clinic was reporting a survival of 50% with surgery alone and no chemotherapy, one of their explanations being that the natural history of the disease had changed and that chemotherapy was no longer necessary .

Below is a photograph of my maternal great, great aunt Martha Leona (Mattie) Roberts. She was the next to the youngest sister of my great grandfather John Taylor Roberts. This is one of the many family photographs that I scanned from my grandmother Leona’s desk at my mom’s house when I was visiting this past March. This aunt is my grandmother Leona’s namesake. Mattie Roberts was born during the Civil War on January 17, 1864, in Berrien County, Georgia [1, 2]. Her parents were William and Margaret (DeVane) Roberts. She married Colquitt Strickland (1857-1924) in Berrien County on January 31, 1883 . Below is a copy of their marriage license on page 299 of the Berrien County marriage book available on Georgia’s Virtual Vault. Mattie and Colquitt had three children: Charles, William, and Luelle . Around the time that the 1900 census was taken, Mattie died on August 10, 1900, at the age of 36 . At the time of Mattie’s death, her children were 16, 12, and 6 years old . I noticed on the 1900 census that Mattie’s sister Beulah (Margaret) Roberts was living with them (See census record below starting at line 27. Click to enlarge). I figured she must have been there to take care of her sister Mattie and help with the household and the children. I also figured that Colquitt married again after Mattie died. I was right. He married Beulah . While I was scrolling though the Strickland burials on the Sunset Hill Cemetery interactive map, I noticed “INF. DTR STRICKLAND.” According to the description, the marker says “Infant Daughter of C. and M. L. Strickland.” There is also a link to the photograph of the marker. There are no birth and death dates. This indicates that Mattie and Colquitt had at least four children instead of three. On the 1900 census, Mattie is recorded has having had three children and all three were living (See census record above). Did this child die when Mattie died? I don’t have a copy of their death records.

Just before Christmas I found myself in Brixton – as one does – and in wandering the streets passed by the H&M. As you might see from my photograph below, it is housed in a fine building. My immediate reaction was that that had to have been a Woolworths. My second reaction was that I knew a man who would know for certain. A couple of tweets later with @soult and he’d confirmed it (even without mentioning where I was, he knew the store and its location). Woolworths it was, and you can just about make out the position of the old fascia at the top of the building if you look carefully. On my return from Brixton, I opened my copy of Kathryn A Morrison’s new book – Woolworth’s; 100 years on the High Street – and on page 75 there’s another shot of the Brixton store (reproduced below). It took real effort of will, and the distraction of exam marking, not to devour her book there and then. But Christmas and early January have provided the time and space to spend some pleasurable hours reading and then thinking about the book. This is not a history of Woolworths, but is rather an architectural guide to its store development. It is the story of Woolworths seen through the prism of its stores, according to the author. With access to an interesting archive, some great contemporary and modern photographs and an engaging and illuminating written commentary, this is a triumph of a book, though given the author’s “previous”, this should be no surprise. This book will be of interest to those – and there are many, and not all are obsessives – still fascinated by Woolworth’s history in the UK. It should also be of interest to those concerned with streets and design and the ways Woolworth and others created the vista of our best modern high streets. Retail forms made ‘concrete’ and built to last. I disagree with Kathryn Morrison when she says “few of these buildings can be classed as great architecture”; on the contrary I think they are often distinctive, well designed and important statements about the company, its operations and the places it operated in. The architecture, whilst “designed by obscure company architects” has many things to say to, and about, the high streets and retailers of today. A couple of other thoughts were developed by my reading, it may be a function of the archive or the approach, but the interest and the developments are very ‘front-loaded’. The recent decades of Woolies, whilst familiar in shop form, were rather functional, bland and comparatively identikit. The contrast with the heyday and the early days is marked in coverage, and I feel, tone. Secondly, it did make me reflect on the very mundaneness of our retail and its rather current sense of impermanence. We don’t build shops like we used to, and that is all too obvious in our streets and retail sheds. When was the last time you saw a modern retail development that made you stand back and say “wow” (and in a nice way)? And in that transition I fear we have lost a lot of our soul and difference and have diminished places and retailing accordingly. Retailers using – or re-using – space in the way their predecessors did are few and far between. Which is a shame. This is a really fascinating book, not only on its subject matter, but in placing Woolworths in this broader context of its history and place. It is very well researched and presented (though I am not yet reconciled to seeing my home town relocated to North Wales on p36 – photo below). For anyone interested in retailing, Woolworths, architecture and places, this book is a treasure trove. Kathryn A Morrison (2015) Woolworth’s: 100 years on the High Street. Historic England; Swindon.

This week we have Brixton (I was a regular visitor to Woolworth’s and Bon Marche in Brixton in the late 1950s and until 1961 when my family moved from Tulse Hill to Croydon, where I remained a customer of Woolworths. Add to that, I was one of the consultants brought in by Hilco to deal with Woolworth’s in administration – I ended closing ten stores around the North, East and West Yorkshire areas. Not all of these were built by Woolworth, and therefore did not demonstrate the obvious Woolworth frontage. Notwithstanding the grand façades that you have pictured, a large number of small town stores such as in Ripon and my native Marlborough were of a more standardized model. It is difficult to disguise them, and it is not unusual to walk through a town for the first time and spotting a former Woolies. Of course they are not alone, probably even more obvious architecture is delivered by the legacy of Montague Burton. These like Woolworths could be found in towns large and small right across the land and are still identifiable even where they are no longer occupied by Burton’s. So where are we off to next? Forgot to give you a heads up for next time. Did you have any dealings with Albert Gubay and Kwik Save? They are next up when I have time. Sorry for stalking you! Unintentional – honestly. Also interested in your Burton comment. Ben much less chatteron them I think, and I know less, but worth looking at I think.

Hi! Sign in to let us know how Hair Champs Salon was? Nadine P. Oct 03 . I don't typically write negative reviews about anyone, but this case Omar merits one. i can sum it up in one word...BUTCHERED! My hair was midway down my back.. all i wanted was some shorter more textured layers. Seems pretty simple for most pros . What i got was a mushroom cap. Its as if he gave me two different haircuts, one in back and one in front, The problem is on the crown, i suppose he calls it texturing, however there's a huge chunk of hair cut right out of the crown, not even in a place you can hide. So basically i have 2 layers, almost like a bowl cut on top, long on the bottom with a big piece missing in the crown. The biggest problem for me is he had to know this during my blowout, as I sure did the next day when i went to blow it our myself. As he was blowing he said to me "oh it falls like a natural bump in the back". Well i did not ask for a bump, hence he knew he screwed up and said nothing, just tried to cover it up. Then just took my money. I know that people make mistakes, but when i called and went in for him to address it he kept saying , "oh i know what WE did" WE? really? no apology, just kept saying it does not look bad. But it is bad! Really bad, probably the WORST cut have EVER had! I also had to add ...someone who reviewed him stated "I would strongly recommend Omar to anyone that is looking for a NY quality stylist in the Raleigh area!", Well i am from NY and there is NOTHING NY quality about the way he does hair. Where were you getting your hair done ,,,on the A train?, even then it would probably still be better than what i got! Adam is absolutely amazing! I have gone to him twice and he has done exactly what I asked for. He even did bangs for me for the first time. They came out awesome. MUST VISIT. WHERE TO BEGIN...I WENT IN THE BEGINNING OF JANUARY. I went becuz my neighbor had her virgin hair bleached by him. it took him 6 hours but it looked wonderful and the price was cheap. so, i make an appointment. Took a chance and got burned...literally!! by dawn43nc at Citysearch Nov 10 . Worst haircut I have ever had. Nothing more to say. Don't go. by c25 at Citysearch Nov 10 . He cut all my hair off, colored it red ( I wanted it blond) and wouldn't repair it. I didn't have any bangs. My friends couldn't believe what a hack job he did. Maybe he didn't like me. I would have gladly left if that was the case. It took forever for it to grow. When I went to another salon that couldn't beieve what a rotton job he did. Don't go. by EllenCustomer at Citysearch Nov 10 . I thought I was dealing with professionals, I should have walked out the minute that man gave me attitude. Not only was he rude, but he chopped off all my hair when I only wanted a trim. I am now stuck with a bad haircut until I can get a new style when it grows back out! I will be very careful next time I want to try a new salon! Cons: Not prefessional, nor talented. by CherylO at Citysearch Nov 10 . I have lived here for almost 4 years and have not been able to find a stylist who is reasonably priced that does outstanding work until I came to Hair Champs and met Adam. He is simply amazing. He listened to me and we actually spent about 20 minutes discussing my lifestyle and what I was all about. He said he knew just what to do and to trust him. I gave it a whirl and WOW the result what just what I wanted both in color and style. I can't wait to get back in to see Adam. I finally found a place that I will continue to visit!!! Jamie S. Feb 05 . had! If you aren't sure exactly what you should do with your hair, you just need to trust him. He is that talented! Tell him Jamie sent you! He will hook you up! Go Once & You'll be Hooked! by ohbe at Citysearch Nov 10 . I prefer to do my hair in this salon for several reasons. First, it's easy to make an appointment, no long waiting period as in other salons with comparable services. Second, Larissa, the owner and stylist, is extremely pleasant and professional. My hair is thin and flat, but with the haircut from Larissa, styling is easy, beautiful shape and added volume. You can trust her taste and skills, just relax in the chair, and she will choose the style that flatters your face and personality. And third, the place is clean and cheerful. And all this for a very reasonable price. What else to look for? I and my both daughters love this salon. Thank you , Larissa! by deena13 at Citysearch Nov 10 . Walid did a great job with my hair. Medium-length haircut - very stylish (I didn't give him specific instructions, so he was creative) and suits my face really well. He also corrected my hair color: I had a terrible mix of highlights, colors etc. - all with about 2inches routes (disaster, yes). He did some highlights and colored the rest, was very meticulous, worked on my hair forever, carefully selecting each strand... Overall, I was VERY pleased. Price was very reasonable too. by hannah801 at Citysearch Nov 10 . From the first time I met Walid, I was really impressed. He is simply the best hairstylist I have ever had. I have gotten my haircut with Walid 4 times now since serendipitiously stumbling upon him. And each time I come to Hair Champs to get my haircut, I always leave feeling completely satisfied and pleased with what an absolutely amazingly job Walid does on my hair. I have never received so many compliments before on my haircut as I do when I get it cut with Walid. Walid always takes his time...sometimes spending more than an hour and a half on my hair...the longest I have ever had any stylist spent on my hair. He is very meticulous and such a perfectionist always making sure that every strand falls in the right place. Not only is Walid very talented and creative, he is also a caring and thoughtful individual constantly making sure that you are doing alright. I would highly recommend Walid to everyone. by jatnc82 at Citysearch Nov 10 . Only place in Raleigh that can cut my hair with clippers. Great if your ex-military! Walid is awesome, he is the consummate professional. The conversation amongst the staff is always interesting and funny. If you go here, take the time to get to know the staff, it definitely make each visit that much better. The price is also the best in town for the quality you get. Their goal is quality, not quantity, you don't pay for frivolous things that other places charge you. You get a cut and a shampoo for $15.00. You might have to wait a bit longer, however when its your turn in the chair, you know that they will take all the time necessary to do the job correctly and to your likening!!!!! If you do not believe me just go get your hair cut here and see for yourself. Best Price, Great Atmoshpere, Amazing Staff - Walid is Great!!! by eyceman at Citysearch Nov 10 . Being new to the area and not knowing too many places, I had gotten a couple of really bad hack-jobs. I stumbled across this place by accident one day (after a movie at the Raleigh Grande) and what an awesome experience! I didnt have an appointment so I waited about 20 minutes (not bad at all). Larissa immediately made me feel at ease. When she was done with my haircut after about 25 minutes it was perfect!! I'm very finicky about my hair and wa a bit nervous at first, but she did such a great job that I talked my wife into going there. She absolutely loved her haircut/style by Walid. Infact now, I even have my little 5 year old going there as well, and he won't go anywhere else! Hair Champs is definitely tops in my books. I highly recommend it for Women, Men AND Children. One of the Best Haircuts... ever! by nyinnc1 at Citysearch Nov 10 . I went to hair champs about a week ago and just wanted to write about my great experience! I wanted
a reminder of our folly. at last. ivy settles in the palm of my hand apparently growing in nothing but fallen debris.
What is Septicemia (Foals) ? Many times foals born in a dirty birthing stall or out in the pasture are more susceptible to developing septicemia. Usually, foals will become ill within three to four days of birth. In some cases, the foal is infected with septicemia in-utero. If this occurs the foal will be born in a weakened state or even comatose. It is important that foals are born within clean conditions. Keeping the birthing stall disinfected and providing clean bedding every day will reduce the risk of septicemia in foals. After every birth, the birthing stall must be scrubbed, preferably with a bleach solution to kill any bacteria that may be present. Septicemia in foals can be fatal if not treated aggressively and quickly. It is a disease that involves bacteria within the bloodstream. The bacteria then infiltrate the tissues of the foal. The bacterial infection will spread through the tissues and affect bones, joints, organs and the central nervous system. Septicemia is a bacterial infection that is caused when bacteria enters the body and then spreads through the bloodstream. Generally, foals that are three to four days old are the most susceptible to septicemia. Those born in dirty conditions are at a higher risk. Septicemia can be fatal if not treated aggressively immediately. Adult horses can also develop septicemia, but instead of the bacteria entering through an umbilical cord, it occurs when the intestinal barrier has been disturbed. Generally, this is from inflammatory bowel disease or a GI obstruction. There is no diagnostic tool available to detect sepsis early. Veterinarians have developed a system that helps identify sepsis at a more treatable stage. Your veterinarian will look at the foal’s medical history, observation of the living conditions and laboratory testing to determine if septicemia is present. A complete blood count and urinalysis will show the presence of bacteria within the foal. Arterial blood gas analysis will also help in diagnosing septicemia. A negative blood culture does not definitively rule out septicemia. Your veterinarian will also look to see what organs, if any, have been affected by the infection. Once a full assessment has been completed and the definitive diagnosis of septicemia has been made, a treatment plan will be set for your foal. Your veterinarian will implement an aggressive treatment plan that will include antibiotics to help reduce the spread of septicemia through the bloodstream. Antimicrobial medications may also be used along with frequent monitoring, fluid therapy, nutritional support, and cardiovascular support. This generally requires that the foal, or horse of any age, be hospitalized during treatment. Anti-endotoxin therapy may be recommended if there are GI disturbances or other illnesses within the abdominal cavity. Supportive care along with round the clock checks will be required for your foal. Most medications required will be administered through an IV. Your veterinarian will discuss all of your treatment options for your foal and help you make the best choice. Immediate, aggressive treatments are required for a foal diagnosed with septicemia. Be sure to administer all medications as prescribed to ensure their maximum effect. If you are unsure of dosing instructions or concerned about any side effects, contact your veterinarian for assistance. Septicemia in foals is fatal if not treated quickly and aggressively. Even then, some foals still do not make it. Speak with your veterinarian about your foal’s prognosis and recovery time. By hospitalizing your foal, recovery time may be increased as opposed to keeping your foal housed in your stable with its mother. Prevention is the best way to avoid septicemia in foals. This means maintaining good hygiene, removing any build up of mud or feces on your mare before and after giving birth. Keeping the new foal clean and out of muddy conditions is also important. Place the expectant mother in the clean, disinfected birthing stall several weeks prior to delivery. This allows her make antibodies that will fight against any pathogens that are commonly found in a foaling environment. Clean the foaling stall daily, disinfect the walls and flooring prior to adding clean bedding. Once the foal is born, wash mother and foal with warm water to remove any birthing fluids and bacteria. Ask your veterinarian about a solution that can be put on the foal’s umbilical cord to help keep bacteria at bay.
A mild degree of oligohydramnios causes no direct detrimental consequences to the fetus. However, severe oligohydramnios does have severe consequences for the fetus, irrespective of cause. In the uterus, the swallowing of water by the fetus promotes the normal development of the fetal lungs, and this is disrupted when there is a marked lack of amniotic fluid (severe oligohydramnios). In other words, chronic severe oligohydramnios may alone be sufficient to cause miscarriage, even when the cause is not known, because of its severe effect on fetal development. In the first trimester of pregnancy, the main source of amniotic fluid is the mother, and a small amount originates from the fetus. In the second and third trimesters, most of the fluid is formed from fetal urine, and a decrease in the normal amount of amniotic fluid usually occurs as a result of a problem in the fetus's urinary tract. Most cases are a result of early rupture of the membranes and breaking of the waters. Sometimes there is a continuous, low-level loss of fluid that the mother does not even feel. Even slight leakage of amniotic fluid can be demonstrated using a special gynecological test. Defects in the urinary tract and/or kidneys that do not allow urination in normal quantities. These can be congenital defects in the development of the kidneys or obstruction of the urinary tract at different levels (in the urethra, ureters, etc.). Placental insufficiency. In this case, signs of delayed fetal growth also appear. There are reports in the literature of a high frequency of chromosome disorders in fetuses with oligohydramnios. In most cases of oligohydramnios arising from chromosome disorders, other defects will also be detected in the fetus. Therefore oligohydramnios alone, without other defects, is not necessarily an indication for amniocentesis, especially if the cause is known (e.g. leakage of amniotic fluid, etc.). What should be done if oligohydramnios is diagnosed? The mother should be asked whether there has been any leakage of amniotic fluid in the period preceding the diagnosis of oligohydramnios. Her excretions should be examined for the presence of amniotic fluid, etc. A 3rd level ultrasound scan should be performed to look for defects, especially in the urinary tract. In cases of severe oligohydramnios, a good fetal scan cannot always be performed. Doppler testing of the placental blood vessels should be carried out in order to check for placental insufficiency. If there is no clear cause, such as leakage of amniotic fluid or placental insufficiency, then the parents should be offered genetic counseling in order to discuss the severity of the condition, its implications, the need for further investigations, and the advisability of performing amniocentesis. In cases where amniocentesis cannot be performed, cordocentesis or chorionic villus sampling through the abdomen can be carried out instead. In cases of severe oligohydramnios, with or without defects in the urinary tract, the parents should be referred to a multidisciplinary clinic in a hospital for professional counseling by an expert in pediatric kidney diseases (nephrologist), a genetic counselor, an expert in ultrasound examinations and a neonatologist in order to collate all the data and discuss what further investigations and interventions, if any, should be undertaken. This will depend on the severity of the oligohydramnios, and whether or not there are any associated defects, etc.

Daniel Akpeyi was the main attraction during the Super Eagles training session watched by Owngoalnigeria.com Maxwell Pius at the training pitch of the Godswill Akpabio Stadium. The Eagles had a light session before splitting into two groups of 8 players each for a practice game, which Akpeyi excelled with save after save to frustrate the forwards he was up against. Akpeyi was difficult to beat throughout the session, and his form is a confirmation of how well he has been performing for his Premier South Africa League side Chippa United‎. The highlight of his performance was stopping a penalty from Leicester City Star Ahmed Musa, and the manner which he stopped shots during their shooting drills. Although Ikechukwu Ezenwa didn’t do badly, Akpeyi was by far the most impressive, however he was up against some of the top strikers of the team so that means he was constantly under pressure as they mounted attacks after attack. A decision on who will start between the duo is expected to be made in the coming days, but for now Akpeyi is in the lead after his performance this evening.

A solid rock fist up for "C.S.A: Confederate States of America" “C.S.A: Confederate States of America” is a truly unique and rare motion picture. What the film lacks in budget, editing, and performances it more than makes up for with an utterly brilliant and awe-inspiring concept. “C.S.A” is confrontational and completely in your face, but in a way that is so bold and smart that any intelligent criticism about what the film may be missing should be overshadowed by its undeniable originality and relevance. With its recent nationwide theatrical release, “C.S.A” is the “little picture that could” not on the strength of the movie-making, but because it needs to be seen, both as great art and as exceptional satire. “C.S.A” supposes what America’s history would have been had the Confederacy won the Civil War. The film pretends to be the presentation of a British television documentary about the history of the “Confederate States of America” from the time of the war to the present. The documentary is being broadcast on a “C.S.A.”-controlled television channel and is frequently interrupted by commercials for products and services that reflect an America where slavery is very much alive and well. Delving into the details of the film would unnecessarily alter the experience of watching the film, so that is all the summation that will be given here. The movie itself has some rather noticeable flaws. It was obviously shot inexpensively and the editing and pace reflect an effort to make the most of what director Kevin Wilmott was able to piece together. He did a fabulous job with what he had to work with, and it is a shame he didn’t have more resources. One wonders what this film would look like if it had a budget that matched the gigantic scope of the ideas within, and begs the question: Would/could a major studio get behind a movie like this? Although Spike Lee’s name is now attached to the film as an executive producer, “C.S.A.” was made independently and without an adequate financing to truly do it justice. Despite the heavy subject matter, “C.S.A.” has moments of great humor interspersed throughout the picture. It begins with a quote from George Bernard Shaw, “If you’re going to tell people the truth, you’d better make them laugh…” A statement which helps to temper the experience and information the viewer is about to witness. It serves valuably to remind you from the start that the movie wants to be laughed at as much as it wants you to feel the impact of its message. Until now “C.S.A: Confederate States of America” has found audiences through limited screenings and film festivals. The nationwide release the film is getting right now may not last long. If your art theater is showing the film, it is worth the trip; if not, DVD will be the format where most people will discover this intriquing picture. This film belongs on college campuses, it belongs in theaters and it belongs in the American conscience, because long after the independent movie “C.S.A.” is over, the ideas it presents remain powerful and totally fascinating.

It's not just about diet, however, vegans avoid exploiting animals for any purpose, with ethical reasons being a key factor in choosing a vegan lifestyle. Shockingly, animal products and products tested on animals can be found in accessories, clothing, and makeup, just to name a few! Fortunately, in today’s world, we have affordable and easily-sourced alternatives available to us. So, what exactly is a Vegan Diet? A vegan diet is richly diverse comprising in fruits, vegetables, nuts, grains, seeds, beans, and pulses. As a vegan, you will learn to be creative in preparation of meals so as to ensure you're never bored. Nowadays, there is a such a hype around veganism that you can buy almost anything, from wraps, pizzas, cakes, even ice-cream that is suitable for a vegan diet as they're made with plant-based ingredients. So what exactly is the difference between veganism and a raw food diet? A vegan diet consists only of plant foods. All meats and other animal products, including milk and eggs, are off-limits. However, some vegans restrict their diets even further by choosing to eat only raw foods, foregoing all foods cooked at temperatures above 118°F (48°C). A raw diet also includes fresh fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds. Although a raw vegan will be more particular about the types of beans and grains they eat and will choose lentils, peas, and quinoa, in their sprouted form, specifically. Soy products on a raw vegan plain are not permitted as these are cooked at temperatures above 118°F (48°C). In a raw food diet, nuts and seeds are raw, not toasted (whereas toasted is allowed in a regular vegan plan). Frozen vegetables are par-cooked before freezing, so they too are not allowed in a raw vegan plan. Inadequate consumption of vitamins and minerals can result in loss of bone and muscle mass. At the end of the day, adopting a vegan lifestyle is a deeply personal choice and one that may not be everybody’s cup of miso soup. BUT, we cannot ignore the fact that Increasingly more and more people have decided to go vegan for ethical and health reasons. It is important for anyone thinking about the vegan route that the transition is done gradually and mindfully. When done correctly a vegan diet has endless benefits, including weight loss, a healthier body, and mind, as well as a deeper sense of ethical respect and responsibility. Join the Energise Academy today! Your health coach Mark Bryant will mentor and guide you through this incredible life transformation.
The Way, a circuit around Calderdale, was pioneered by local civic trusts and groups who came together under the umbrella of the Calderdale Way Association. The main and link routes to the valley bottom are designed so that they can be completed in short stages. The walk encircles Halifax, Hebden Bridge and Todmorden, following old packhorse ways across the open gritstone hillsides with sections of traditional stone causeway, passing through hillside villages and old mill towns on the banks of the River Calder. There are numerous link paths which connect the Calderdale Way to the valley floor. There are medieval settlements at Lumbutts and Mankinholes, and Withens Gate, where the Pennine Way crosses. A short diversion along the Pennine Way takes in the popular walk to the 100ft monument, Stoodley Pike.
Providing orthodontic care to Suffern, Sloatsburg, Montebello, and all surrounding New York communities. Getting to know the local families and treating their children has been a dream come true for me. Having a true family practice was exactly the way I had always envisioned myself during my training and schooling. I knew orthodontics was the right career choice for me from the very beginning. Growing up in Staten Island, NY, I always enjoyed order and organization in contrast to my laid back personality and down to earth demeanor. These traits all blended together well and have made a great balance for a successful orthodontist. I always want to make my patients comfortable and at home, yet get the job done well. I was then lucky enough to have been given the opportunity to receive my education from the United States Air Force training program, helping me to complete my degree in orthodontics. I participate in year-round continuing education courses so that I can stay current on the latest technology available. My patients deserve the best and this allows for that to be possible. I strongly believe in giving back to the community organizations that make this neighborhood such a wonderful place. Every year I happily contribute to sponsor or support many local sports teams, charities, and community fundraisers. After enjoying traveling the globe gaining knowledge and experience while treating hundreds of U.S. servicemen, women, and their families, I now enjoy being back home permanently in New York. I spend my leisure time with my wife and our two daughters, who were born while we were stationed in Okinawa, Japan. We have become the hub of our family since we returned to the U.S. in 2005. Hosting and entertaining our large family and friends for most holidays and special occasions and making up for lost time are at the top of our list these days. I can’t wait to meet you and have you become part of our Ramapo Orthodontics family!

Name is the starting point for all universal and sacred laws of life, whether it is called Universal Mind, Divine Oneness or God Almighty. It is universal because all human activity—personal, socio-cultural, economic and political—issues from a name, from the smallest quanta of matter or energy to the largest telescopic view of the celestial heavens. Names and naming are basic to etymology, language development and linguistics, and to the formation and evolution of human occupations like horticulture, engineering and psychiatry. But did you know human beings have the mandate to name? This feature makes this principle universal, spiritual and audacious all at the same time. NAMING TRADITIONS. Naming in primary, a-literate or pre-historic cultures was multi-faceted, and many forms of early naming traditions continue today. Especially in societies that are less media-saturated than Western ones, child naming is a huge event, and one’s name signifies a connection to clan and community. For example, if a dramatic event occurs to a mother and the child is born soon afterward, the family leader may decide the baby’s name and base it on the event. If the clan or tribe experiences some upheaval or transformation and it coincides with the birthing, the child may be named for this circumstance. If someone dreams of the baby telling its own name, this is another way a child claims its name. Many societies wait seven or eight days before naming a child to see what the world brings forth or what the child does to give a clue to its name. Infant behavior as well as situational changes as a result of infant arrival result in unusual but appropriate names. Some children are named for the day, week or month they were born, or for a predestined life path that their date of birth indicates. These beliefs are why there are naming ceremonies and rites of passage marking milestones, including puberty and earned name changes, reached by cohort members. Some people mature into a new name because of a profession or creative work. There are nicknames, stage names, pet names and pen names (often, in the singular, referred to as a nom de plume) that people take on and release—it goes both ways. Sojourner Truth, Marilyn Monroe, Whoopi Goldberg, Chevy Chase and Malcolm “X” Shabazz are examples of name-changers. I found out who I was by undertaking a journey to rename myself. My birth name triggered me, I felt a bumble of words in my head that did not help me to locate who or where I was in time. Bumping up against my given name meant I was missing a point of access to who I was being in the world. My vision of the world felt obstructed. Nancy Regun Ethelind Clare. Not only was Regan misspelled on my birth certificate according to my mother, the order was wrong. My beloved grandmother’s first name Ethelind should have been before my father’s sister’s middle name Regan. Nancy Regun was uncomfortably close to Nancy Reagan, Ronald Reagan’s wife. As First Lady of the U.S. and Republican party, she and I had little in common. My discomfort with Nancy begins with the shrill manner in which my mother called me which communicated impatience and criticism. It was not the “Nancy With the Smiling Face” lilt sung by Frank Sinatra about his daughter. My mother’s aunt was named Nancy. I eventually read that Nancy meant grateful or grace of God, as did Ann, Jean, John, Ian, Sean, and similar European names. They were derived from John the Baptist, said to be the first person so named. Not unexpectedly, I hung out with musicians and declared myself married to one in 1978. I met him at a Halloween party in Soho with live music by Olu Dara. The party continued into the early hours of the morning, All Saint’s Day, at someone’s home in the Bronx. This strikes me now as important but did not at the time. On his first visit to my home, Khalid Abdul Raheem (aka Jack) brought me a Qur’an to read. This began my Islamic education. Meanwhile, people had begun to call me Niamo based on my writings, since I had prefixed it to my name: Niamo Nancy Clare. I was so proud of this unique and beautiful name. In an otherworldly episode I learned to detach from it, and this was a turning point in my spiritual journey. I got the surprise of my life while attending a showcase of a playwright’s new work. In the small audience of not more than fifty people I noticed a woman who looked like the late Elizabeth Taylor, noted for the Cleopatra stereotype provided courtesy of Hollywood. This woman could not be mistaken for Ms. Taylor, she just had that look and a stylish bearing to match. I had loved the movie Ms. Taylor starred in, National Velvet, as a child, partly because I shared a love of horses. I secretly fancied myself a brown-skinned Taylor because of my long mane. I looked nothing like her, but had been dazzled by her stardom. As an adult, to notice someone reminding me of her was no big thing but in reflection, I chuckled to myself. At the end of the play my friend and I stayed a bit longer to meet the playwright, who she knew. As we were being introduced, I noticed the Taylor look-alike drawing nearer and she too knew the writer. We were introduced and I told her my name. She said, “Oh, I know someone named Niamo. That’s a pretty name.” I conveyed my thanks and surprise. The Niamo she knew resided in Chicago, where she was from. I asked if that woman had ever lived in California, where I attended college. She indeed had. When I named the college, she said she believed that was it. When I asked was she an art major and did she have blond hair and was she kind of tall and slim? Yes, she said, she was. I realized there was a woman in my classes who liked the name I signed on my paintings. Most still called me Nancy at the time. My earliest college art was signed by the pen name Jam, because I liked the way “byJam,” with the “Y” and “J” connected, looked. This “handle” began in junior high school. At the time a jam to me meant a jam session, the ultimate in jazz improvisation. Later I read it symbolically. Years of French taught me je meant “I” and “Am” could be a short form of aime meaning love. So we could interpret Jam as I AM or I Love. It was very important that I not be “Hordinary”—the worst thing a person could be, uttered by my grandfather in his Tobagonian accent. No, each member of our clan was committed to being special—anything but ordinary. Anyway, I concluded, “This girl stole my name!” I looked at the irony of it—a “white” girl, a classmate who met me fleetingly, just up and took my name! I felt forced to deal with my unexpressed feelings. Anger—How dare she? Sadness—I’m not unique! Shock—this totally caught me off guard. Awe—She up and took my name and made it her own! Disgust and defeat—She doesn’t even know what it means, how I arrived at the name, or how important it is to me! This is horrendous, I lamented in self-pity. I am not special after all! One of the things that helped me get over this was a few lines from “For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow is Enuf,” the ground-breaking play by Ntozake Shange. At the time, I mentally dared anyone to steal her name. The lines I loved were, “Somebody done walked off with alla my stuff and they don’t even know what to do with it.” Although spoken of a boyfriend, this line let me know people did take stuff and you would feel the loss of it. I felt loss and realized I could wail about it to no avail. My worry and feeling insulted would not change the experience. Plus, I still owned the name, even moreso than I had before. It took on new meaning. I found myself releasing the attachment to what I had held as an exclusive appellation. Although the name helped me feel special, it was more like the book cover of my life, and not me. It took years before I grasped the “book cover” nature of the name Niamo.

Leicester City Football Club have agreed terms with AS Monaco for the loan of midfielder Youri Tielemans until the end of the 2018/19 season, subject to Premier League and international clearance. The deal will also see Leicester City midfielder Adrien Silva join the Ligue 1 side on loan until the end of the current campaign. Tielemans arrives at Leicester City after an impressive 18 months with AS Monaco, where he featured 65 times in all competitions, scoring six goals – five of those coming this term. The talented Belgium international, who represented his country at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, is a product of Anderlecht’s Youth Academy and is considered one of the most exciting prospects in European football. Thumbs up from the exciting young attacker as he poses for a signing photo in the home dugout at King Power Stadium. Speaking to LCFC TV, Tielemans said:"I’m really excited to get going. The Premier League is one of the best leagues in the world and when I was young, I always watched Premier League games. I’m really happy to be here and I’m excited to get started. Born in Sint-Pieters-Leeuw in Belgium, Tielemans started his career with Anderlecht, signing his first professional contract in July 2013, aged just 16. He went on to make his Champions League debut three months later, becoming the youngest Belgian player to ever feature in the competition. Tielemans made 185 appearances for Anderlecht in all competitions over four seasons, scoring 35 goals, and helped the side to two Belgian Pro League titles. In his first two seasons, he was voted Belgian Young Professional Footballer of the Year and in 2016/17, Belgian Professional Footballer of the Year. Tielemans arrives on loan at King Power Stadium until the end of the 2018/19 Premier League season. After moving to AS Monaco in the summer of 2017, he made his debut for the club against Paris Saint-Germain and went on to appear 35 times for the side in his first season. His performances in the French top tier have continued to catch the eye this term, having found the net five times in just 20 Ligue 1 appearances from midfield. At international level, the exciting youngster made his debut for the Belgium national team in November 2016 and has gone on to feature for them 19 times. He was also part of the Belgium squad that placed third at the 2018 FIFA World Cup – starting in both victories against England in Russia.

It's summer and that means BBQ's, tacos out by the pool, beach days, and late night sun. It's all fun and games in countries where communism isn't the rule. Consumer goods line the shelves, there are open air markets, restaurants deliver delicious meals - we take it for granted. That's just how it is. If you're a communist, the summer experience is more like the picture (right). Summer in North Korea means that you can work in the fields longer for food that somebody else will eat. You won't be compensated for that, but hey, everyone is a comrade. Everyone is equal but some, such as the over-fed dear leader, are clearly more equal than others. Everyone expects the Norks to starve because that's all they've done since the communists claimed power. The rest of the world is a different thing. We don't expect people to starve (unless they're in Africa). For the last twenty years all anybody in Venezuela talked about was politics. Over expensive meals, black label whiskey and cold beer on street corners the endless debate raged: revolution, popular democracy, participatory democracy. Conspiracies, the empire – planning; oh, the endless planning. Then came Hugo Chavez and communism...which we all knew was the beginning of the end. Are we all a species of Cassandra (prophetess blessed to see the future but cursed that she would not be believed)? Apparently that is the case. It takes a mighty poor prophet to predict that communism/national socialism, whatever the name, to impoverish a nation. The only thing people talk about in Venezuela today is food. Where can you find milk? Has anybody seen eggs? Cheese, butter, chicken – these are the topics, on street corners in front of boarded up kiosks where the drunken debates used to rage. The beer is now gone, and sobriety is a heartless companion. It’s humiliating, but hungry people don’t have the luxury of pride. The Hollywood crowd love to talk about redistribution. They haven't yet told the people of Venezuela what to do when all the money in the universe will not buy a loaf of bread. Communism has built land of consumers, nobody is left who can produce. George Clooney isn't there to experience the reality that: orders and threats and storm troopers cannot turn that money into milk and butter and eggs. That is – and always has been – the job of free citizens. Venezuela is a communist/socialist Sanders utopia - and there are no more free citizens. It's Atlas Shrugged in action. And even though there is a free college education for all, the people of Venezuela have other problems at the moment, distracting from their studies...because you can't study effectively when your belly button is stuck to your backbone. Put that into your pipe and smoke it, Bernie. The Mainstream Media don't have much to say about people starving in Venezuela (awash with oil) who are living the dream that is democratic socialism. I wonder why? I can't help but reflect on the men who crushed the Nazi war machine (and yes, that includes the Russians who died in vast numbers to end Hitler) and the unrestrained ambitions of Imperial Japan, which was no less cruel than the Germans. It's June 6, the anniversary of D-Day, and two years previously of the end of the Battle of Midway. Both were seminal events in a war that defined a generation that is very thin these days. A YouGov survey showed that only 30% of men ages 25-35 defined themselves as masculine. I don't know how valid that survey is but I'd wager that many of the men that identified themselves in that way served their in the military. The older the group surveyed, the more of the men who responded defined themselves as masculine. Is the change the result of propaganda designed to emasculate men, put out by the mainstream media. Do young men idolize Bruce Jenner, woman of the year? I don't get it. Then again, I'm not in that 70% demographic of young men who see themselves as "feminine". study the "beautiful" history of Islam. It's interesting that men who identify themselves as "masculine" are referred to by the mainstream media as somehow less than human (mouth breathers, neanderthals, etc.). The phony tough don't understand that it can be a mistake to push a man to violence when violence is what that man has dedicated his life to perfecting. Living in the liberal world of those who "feel the Bern" and expect live to be handed to them "free", people forget that there are others who don't see the world in those terms at all. The men who secured freedom for generations did not have the luxury of s parasitically feeding off others. They would never have done so even if the opportunity existed. Both the men and women of that generation are not the least bit politically correct in the current world that we live in. They felt that many people living in the Middle East were savages. In some countries, such as Canada and England, stating the obvious is against the law. They knew that in order to be free, one had to be prosperous and have security. And without both, you would have neither. I know what they'd say of the present generation and its trend toward the absurd, and those words would not be generous or kind.
So you just accidentally deleted a batch of files on your USB flash drive? Or the files got hidden or missing for some reasons? Maybe worse yet, your USB couldn't be detected by a computer. Anyway, in this definitive guide here we're going to show you how to recover deleted or lost files, no matter what situation you are facing. To make it easier for you to browse, we break down all types of USB data loss situations into different scenarios, so you can quickly match your situation and find respective fix solutions. Do use the Table of Content below to help yourself navigate. Chapter 1: Accidentally Deleted Files from a Flash Drive? Chapter 2: Formatted USB Flash Drive By Mistake? Chapter 3: All Files and Folders Became Shortcuts in USB Drive? Chapter 4: USB Disk Shows Error Due to Corruption? Chapter 5: USB Drive Can't Be Recognized by a Computer? You may have removed some files from your disk, thinking they would go to the Recycle Bin or Trash. But the fact is those items will bypass the bin. When you delete something from an external drive, it's similar to emptying Recycle Bin or Trash on your computer. But there is still a way to retrieve them. How to recover: the best way is to use a USB data recovery program (as we introduce in Chapter 6 below). Beware that such software only recovers deleted files that are not overwritten yet, meaning you should try to not use your flash drive when you realized some items had gotten deleted. Sometimes you need to free up more disk space, so you just "quick format" the drive without thinking much about the data stored inside. The operation is irreversible meaning there is no such "unformat" function. Fortunately, it's still quite possible to rescue the data. How to recover: once again, by using a USB data recovery software. A quick disk formatting won't erase the data stored inside immediately. In fact, the data will retain intact there for quite a while depending on how large its volume is and how aggressive you generate additional data. Similar to accidental deletion, these formatted files are recoverable only when they are not fully written over. Most likely your flash drive has been infected by certain virus or malware. All the folders and items are now turned into shortcuts, usually a few kilobytes (KBs) in size. This has been a known issue for years, good news is that you can restore your folders and files in a couple of steps. How to fix: we've covered this in another article how to fix file folders become shortcuts, go check it out there. If you plug your USB drive into a computer and click on it, a pop-up window shows "the disk is not formatted, do you want to format it now?" or it says "the drive can't be initiated", chances are that your pen drive is corrupted or crashed. How to fix: refer to this article how to fix usb not formatted error for detailed instructions on recovering your data and making the device work again. There are two mainly reasons for this: file system or device driver issues, or your USB is physically damaged. Either way, you may still be able to make it work again and access the data normally. However, be prepared to spend a bit more time. How to fix: first follow the guide in this MakeUseOf article to update USB drivers or partition it correctly. If you suspect that your flash disk is damaged, watch this video for how to get the files out of a damaged USB stick. Please note: you'll need to rely on a computer to run the recovery software to retrieve your deleted or inaccessible files. And it's not 100% guaranteed that you'll get all your data back, but it's at least worth a try. If you are using a Windows PC, try Easy Drive Data Recovery — an incredibly powerful and easy-to-use tool designed by Munsoft dedicated to recovering many types of files deleted or lost from an external disk drive. If you are on a Mac machine (MacBook, iMac, etc.), get Stellar Phoenix Mac Data Recovery — an app that was originally developed to retrieve data from the internal Macintosh hard drive, but now it also works amazingly well to pull back data from external disks. First off, turn on your computer, open a web browser such as IE, Chrome or Safari. Get a USB recovery program we recommended above and install it on your computer. Now insert your flash drive into the USB port on your computer. Open "This PC" (in Windows) or "Disk Utility" (for Mac) to check and make sure the disk can be recognized. Now launch the recovery software. Follow its instructions on the screen to select the right drive or file types to conduct a scan. The scanning process can take several minutes depending upon your disk volume. When the scan is complete. Preview the found files and recover those items you want. If you've deleted files from USB drive or formatted it, stop using the device right away. Because any additional data writing activities to the disk may overwrite the old files thus decreasing the recovery rate. Always put your flash disk in a safe environment — meaning less possible suffer statics, water damage or physical drop. Backup and backup the data regularly. All digital devices will fail eventually and you never know when that will happen, backup is king to keep your data safe. Try not plug your USB key to a computer that you're not familiar with, especially those in public places. You never know if the computer has a virus or not. While it's super convenient to carry a USB flash drive and access the data whenever we need, it's also prone for the small storage device to go wrong either with human mis-operations or device crash/damage issues. Hope you find this USB data recovery guide useful. Best of all, good luck on recovering your lost items. If you have any further questions or suggestions, leave a comment below and let us know.
Kieran Little, 18, from Blyth, Northumberland, is the current student fronting the national I Can campaign from RNC. His desire to help the College challenge stereotypical thinking surrounding people with sight loss meant that he wanted to demonstrate the abilities he has which place him on a par with any sighted counterpart in his chosen industry. Kieran has completed an OCR Level 3 in Media alongside a BTEC Level 3 in IT. He proudly became one of six learners at the College to study the CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) qualification. RNC was launched as Europe’s first Cisco Networking Academy for people with visual impairments in September 2014. In his video for the I Can campaign, Kieran talks the viewer through the networking system – such is his confidence in the abilities he has learnt. He utilised the teaching skills he has acquired as one of the student teachers of the Tech Novice Café, a drop-in session for people with and without visual impairments to learn the equipment of their choice, as defined by their own needs and wishes. Media is Kieran’s passion, but he feels networking is a practical job prospect. He would love to have an apprenticeship or work experience with Cisco; as Kieran says: “I can network”.

Raspberry Shortcake® Raspberry is a small shrub that is commonly grown for its edible qualities. It produces red heart-shaped berries which are usually ready for picking in mid summer. The berries have a sweet taste. Raspberry Shortcake® Raspberry has green foliage throughout the season. The textured oval compound leaves do not develop any appreciable fall color. The flowers are not ornamentally significant. It features an abundance of magnificent red berries in mid summer. Raspberry Shortcake® Raspberry will grow to be about 3 feet tall at maturity, with a spread of 3 feet. It tends to be a little leggy, with a typical clearance of 1 foot from the ground. It grows at a fast rate, and under ideal conditions can be expected to live for approximately 10 years. This is a self-pollinating variety, so it doesn't require a second plant nearby to set fruit. Raspberry Shortcake® Raspberry is a good choice for the edible garden, but it is also well-suited for use in outdoor pots and containers. With its upright habit of growth, it is best suited for use as a 'thriller' in the 'spiller-thriller-filler' container combination; plant it near the center of the pot, surrounded by smaller plants and those that spill over the edges. Note that when grown in a container, it may not perform exactly as indicated on the tag - this is to be expected. Also note that when growing plants in outdoor containers and baskets, they may require more frequent waterings than they would in the yard or garden.

Here are the final phases of my Summer Studio Experiments paintings on paper. These served as explorations of paint texture and ability and are a practice that I think I will continue as a personal project. What's going on now? The first semester of my MFA is off to a speedy start- hang on everybody!
By now, most Americans know about the desire of GM management and labor unions to have the taxpayers give them billions of dollars. The plan is to keep the Detroit automobile manufacturers going for a while longer. Not even the staunchest advocates of the Detroit bailout believe that giving them billions of dollars will yield any permanent results; everybody plans to re-visit the issue next year. GM and the UAW find themselves in this position because of a long history of lavish pay and benefit packages for union workers - twice the labor costs of the competition and about three times the non-automotive labor cost. Although there's been a lot of complaint about high-paid managers, there are relatively few of these high-paid people. Plant-floor workers don't get paid as much as the executives, but there are a whole lot more of them. In the grand scheme of things, plant-floor labor cost matters a whole lot more than executive pay but that fact gets lost in the yelling and screaming about making workers sacrifice their livelihoods. The desire to provide workers with a dignified old age via some sort of pension is a noble and humanitarian impulse, but UAW-type pensions simply aren't practical given that people are living so much longer than expected. The way GM pensions work out, people receive pensions for longer than they worked. One way to look it this is to assume that if people collect pensions for only as long as they work, their actual productivity while working is cut in half. Since the company has to pay the worker one year of retirement for every year of work, their actual productivity in terms of work done per dollar of wages and benefits is cut in half. How well would our economy work if every worker's productivity were cut in half? That's the bottom-line, long-term effect of UAW-style pensions - productivity is cut in half and our lifestyle will suffer. People are expected to continue living longer and longer unless government regulations make medical research unprofitable. This immense pension cost has driven GM to the point of bankruptcy and makes it impossible to operate the business at a profit even if government continues to shovel billions of tax dollars to Detroit. As vast as the problems of GM are, and as great the potential damage to our economy should it finally collapse, however, GM's problem with the cost of pensions is nothing compared to the pension problems at all levels of American government. While GM was mortgaging its future to retiree pensions and health care, politicians were doing the same thing by awarding unaffordable pensions and health care to public employees. The difference was that while the UAW was not able to force GM to fire managers who wouldn't give the UAW what it wanted, public employee unions could and did vote politicians who didn't cave on pensions out of office. As a result, New York City employees have been promised pensions which are even more generous than GM's. The book While America Aged by Roger Lowenstein (New York, Penguin Press, 2008) gives some numbers on page 140. In 2005, the New York City Actuary noted that the city transit system contributed $381 million, or 14% of payroll, to pensions; this was expected to reach $620 million by 2009. Medical costs in 2005 were an additional $410 million. It's interesting to compare these numbers with income tax which runs roughly 30% of payroll. Health care and retirement each cost more than income tax. The rest of the city was no better off; the fire department paid $490 million in health-care costs, for example. Health care for retired fire workers has been rising fast enough that the taxpayers will soon be paying more for all the retired fire fighters than for all the working fire fighters! During the recent financial boom, New York City made enough money from income taxes paid by high-flying Wall Street workers that they were able to meet these obligations. Then 2008 happened. With Wall Street bonuses a matter of history and the state facing a corresponding shortfall in income tax receipts, these expenditures are simply not sustainable. There's a fatal flaw in offering benefits 20, 30, or 40 years out - nobody knows what economic conditions will be like when the bills come due. Consider social security. Although the law called social security an insurance program, courts have repeatedly declared it to be a welfare program because Congress can change the benefits at any time. Even if it were an insurance system, there'd be no money in it because our legislators have spent the entire fund, leaving only treasury IOU's; they simply won't leave the money alone. In its greatest high-profit days, GM wasn't able to put enough money aside to fund its pensions. New York City couldn't either. California has been tapping into its employee pension fund, CALPERS has lost a quarter of its value since June and is talking about demanding additional contributions. New Jersey is billions of dollars in the hole yet Gov. Jon Corzine wants county and municipal governments to skip more than $500 million in pension payments to avoid higher property taxes. In an article "The Land of Liabilities," the Economist lists immense unfunded pension liabilities in many states. Maine and New Hampshire have raided the teacher's retirement fund for current expenses, and so on. The overall situation is serious enough that some Congresspersons are calling on government to nationalize everyone's private 401(k) retirement accounts to try to paper over the holes in the public pension problem by snatching private retirement savings. We see that a) most of the public and private pension systems are under-funded, the money simply isn't there; and b) even if the money were there, what could it be invested in which won't get confiscated or misallocated by government action over a 40 year period? As a nation, as companies, and as individuals, we're trapped between a rock and a very hard place indeed. So how are all these pension claims going to be paid? The Economist article ends, "Taxpayers will have to ante up. The main question is when, and how much." There are only two choices: a) pensions won't be paid or b) taxes will go through the roof, collapsing the economy and eventually resulting in (a). Our lawmakers don't dare raise taxes nearly enough to fund the pensions they've already promised, but that doesn't stop them from promising more, regardless of party. George W. Bush, supposedly an arch-conservative, pushed through the largest entitlement expansion of all time in the form of his Medicare drug bill. People we've talked to say, "There's no way this won't be paid, it's protected by law!" No matter what the law says now, however, when pensions start to eat up, say, half of everyone's income, voters will instruct their elected representatives to change the law. There'll be a massive train wreck between taxpayers, public employee unions, and retirees; the longer it's delayed, the worse it will be. The discussions about bailing out Detroit have inspired state and city governments to ask for bailouts, too. The GM bailout is all about protecting workers' pensions; there is simply no way that any profit-making company can cover the cost of operating an automobile business and pay such generous pension obligations at the same time. Even governments which don't have to make a profit and which cavalierly exact taxes at gunpoint are finding it impossible to keep up with their pension obligations. Tennessee's Sen. Corker was correct in pointing out that unless the UAW accepts cuts in labor costs which get close to labor costs at Toyota, Honda, and the other transplants - which is to say, having their pay and pensions slashed roughly in half - there's no way any amount of money can do anything more than postpone the inevitable collapse of GM, at vast public expense. When a private firm goes bankrupt, its pensions are dumped on an agency of the federal government, called the Pension Benefits Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). This agency uses taxpayer dollars to make sure retirees continue to receive a minimum level of benefits, but not nearly as much as they were promised; it usually cuts pensions in half. Even after such a severe pension haircut, so many airlines have dumped their pensions that this agency is well under water. Lacking the same power to threaten confiscation or print more money, New York State's taxing authority has not been able to handle the cost of meeting its pension obligations while maintaining public services during the downturn; cuts are projected. Could any force other than bankruptcy or acute poverty give New York the strength to stand up to the unions and cut costs? Obviously not; bankruptcy or poverty it shall be, perhaps both. Just the other week we saw an astonishing list of new taxes to clobber New Yorkers when they can least afford it; anyone familiar with the Laffer Curve will not be

doTERRA essential oils + chocolate = delicious! And Christmas time is perfect for making some oil flavoured chocolate treats. My favourite doTERRA oils for pairing with chocolate are: Peppermint • Wild Orange • Ginger • Lime. PEPPERMINT CHOCOLATE BARK is really, really simple to make and perfect for having on hand for holiday guests who drop by unexpectedly. Or wrap some chocolate bark in cellophane bags for a sweet gift for neighbours or friends. THE HOW TO .. is pretty much melt your chocolate, add your bits and freeze until set. Snap into pieces and you're good to go! For those who like a bit more detail, here's how I made this batch! Usually I just use white and dark chocolate + hopped pistachios and dried cranberries but this one is a nit of a fun festive twist! Use the double boiler saucepan method to gently melt your chopped dark chocolate on the cook top. Set aside and melt your white chocolate using the same process (or melt your chopped chocolate in a microwave using a microwave safe bowl or jug if you prefer). Allow your melted dark chocolate to cool for a few minutes. Stir in 2-3 drops of doTERRA Peppermint essential oil. Spread the melted dark chocolate onto a sheet of baking paper. Add drops of white chocolate and using a sharp knife point, swirl the white chocolate through the dark for a marble look. Sprinkle on chopped cranberries, chopped nuts and smashed candy cane lollies. Allow to set in the fridge or freezer for a quicker result (if you are impatient like me!!) and once set, snap into bark pieces. Store in the fridge. Package in cellophane bags for gift giving or a baking paper lined gift tin.
In about the time it takes to read this page, you can make your next trip significantly safer. This quick and practical walk-around inspection is not intended to replace periodic visibility tests on a FMVSS 111 Mirror Grid. The pre-trip walk-around inspection is not always enforced as mandatory for school bus drivers. But since mirrors can be bumped and manipulated during and between runs, aquiring this habit could turn a minimal effort into a major difference in human transportation safety. Go to the rear corners of the bus at the back bumpers. Peer down the side panels of the bus towards the front. You should be able to see some portion of the cross view mirrors extended out wider that the school bus body. Most cross view mirrors are around 14” wide. It would be good to see least 4” to 6” of mirror surface extending out beyond the 96” width of the bus. Next, crouch down adjacent to the rear tires. Can you see the cross view mirrors extending out? Look for a least 30% to 40% of the cross view mirror lens to be visible from your vantage point about a foot out from the rear axle locations. Check both sides of the bus. Walk out directly in front of the bus 12’ to 14’ feet and directly in front of the center of the front bumper. Look at both the RH and LH cross view mirrors. You should be able to see some portion the edges of the mirror's reflective surface pointed towards you. Crouch down at the entrance door step well. Can you see your reflected image in the convex rear view mirror? Having a good view of the step well area augmented by the convex rearview mirror can prevent the worst accidents. The convex rear view will provide a much larger and more noticeable image of a child in this most dangerous area. The most efficient adjustment of the rear view mirrors will show less than ½” of reflection of the school bus side walls and windows on the inside vertical surface of the mirror. The least amount of school bus that can be seen in the rear view mirrors the better. Just a narrow visual reference of the side of the bus is all that is needed. This will insure that most of mirror surface is available to see more children and cars. Often the cross view mirrors are positioned inwards for compactness at the factory or during delivery. To swing the mirror arms outwards for best visibility down the sides of the bus, the brace arm clamps and the main mounting base clamps should be loosened to allow the arms to swing out board. A typical school bus is generally about 96” wide, so by measuring from outside edge to outside edge of the cross view mirrors you should have a least about 104” for efficient visibility.

Why are you running for office? I was inspired to run for the legislature out of a sense of service to my community. Everything that happens in Augusta impacts everyone in Maine, from the taxes we pay to the education we provide for our children. In my first session I focused on workforce development, job creation and growing Maine’s economy. The Speaker of the House selected me as one of only two freshman legislators to serve on a special committee charged to find ways to support and grow our workforce and our economy. My background in small business and education enabled me to be a contributor to the bold and creative solutions that will help jump start our economy and help people gain the education and training they need to make a livable wage. One of the best parts of my job as a legislator has been to assist citizens and small business owners with their individual concerns. It has been a joy to see the positive results in a person’s life when I have been able to intervene on their behalf. The people in my district are important to me and I am honored to represent them in Augusta; I will continue to work hard and be their strong voice in Augusta. Health care is a right not a privilege. That’s why I support life-saving health care for 70,000 Mainers, including nearly 3,000 veterans. No one should be bankrupt by mounting medical bills when they are sick. Our economy will also see a $1 million per day boost in economic activity, so it’s right morally and economically. What, if anything, would you change about welfare?I think the best anti-poverty program is a good job. Mainers deserve leaders who are going to work for economic opportunity for everyone. Though there is no data that Maine has widespread fraud in our welfare programs, fraud in any state program is unacceptable. By how much?No one can live on the current minimum wage and raising it needs to be part of a comprehensive economic program aimed at making Maine's economy work for everyone. Please explain your position on legalization?Maine law recognizes marijuana products for medical use because of their powerful properties to assist patients with serious medical conditions. If we recognize this substance as a medicine, I don’t believe we should also legalize its use for “recreation” any more than we do any other medicine.

The City of Paterson has been severely impacted by flooding along the Passaic River. The City, with funding from the State Green Acres Program, has initiated a buy-back program to acquire these properties, demolish them and move habitants from the flood prone area. The City of Paterson buy-back program is called the Paterson Northside Property Buyback Program Acquisition / Demolition Project. JM Sorge, Inc. (JMS) was retained by the City of Paterson to conduct Preliminary Assessments (PA) for 30-50 of these properties. JMS has completed more than half of the PAs, all in accordance with the Technical Requirements for Site Remediation (TRSR) and Green Acres standards. These properties will be purchased and the structures demolished, protecting the City from the liabilities associated with repeated flooding events here.
Why does my battery drain fast when I'm not using the device? Whenever I wake my Transformer up after it has been used for awhile, the amount of charge left in the battery is much lower than I expect. The Transformer is supposed to be in sleep mode, but the battery life has decreased too much for the device to really be sleeping, I feel. The ASUS Download Page can be found here - ASUS T100TA Download Page, in case they update the BIOS again, or you need any of the drivers for your T100. I can honestly say that after a year of use i know all about this.. its areal problem with the T100 out the box. to fix this you need to disable the HIBERFILE, just Google "how to turn off hibernate in Windows 8.1" then delete your HIBERFILE and your good to go, now power off will power off ! Battery charges in about 2 hours and stays charged! I'm running bios 306. When I use Asus Live Update to scan for updates 307 isn't shown as an update. I've read on some postings that 307 is for the computers with a hard drive, but not sure if that is correct. I'm going to stay with 306 since it is working for me. I too was having issues with the battery draining when it was in storage. I only use my T100 occasionally. I changed the settings in "Change what closing the lid does". When it was set to put the computer to sleep on battery when the lid was closed the battery drained. I changed the setting to "shut down" the computer when the power button is used, or the lid is closed while on battery and the battery is now staying charged. Alex Pink 가/이 대단히 고마워 할 것입니다.

Just one of many Leo’s lunchtime celebrations to come this semester — National Backwards Day — is currently going on at Leo’s. Personally, I was expecting to be totally confused when I walked in, with the pasta line in the normal location of the stir-fry line, and vice versa. But all I found was a cake with “NWOTEGROEG” written on it, some mixed up name tags (Kim the pasta chef was wearing the name Diane), and some pretty tasty meatloaf cupcakes with mashed potato frosting. But, I always love it when Leo’s spices it up for a little bit of fun in the middle of a dull day of classes. I say, head to Leo’s for Backwards Day and try to find some backwards things that I couldn’t. Enjoy some meatloaf cupcakes or a smoothie at Stacey’s Spot.

After he entered the ministry, he decided to use his knowledge and expertise to embark on what he calls a “social justice mission” that provides the community with an afordable alternative to payday lenders.
Many people who experience a traumatic event also experience some Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms after the trauma; therefore, this response is considered normal (Resick, Monson, & Chard, 2008b). The difference with individuals who develop clinical levels of PTSD is that they have been unsuccessful in their attempts to incorporate the trauma event into their previously held belief systems. Mr. Brown (not his real name) is a 37 year-old, Caucasian male who has never been married and has no children. Currently, Mr. Brown resides in a Midwestern correctional institution.

We opened this blog because we both love fashion. Both of us spend a massive amount of time in the mornings trying to figure out what to wear. Both of us spend a fortune on clothes when we know we really don't need new ones. Both of us browse through Teen Vogue, read about one party or another and view the outfits and dresses of all the glamorous peole who showed up. Both of us look around the internet and build never-ending wishlists. And true, we're only 15 and most 15-year-olds don't just open their own fashion blog, but we did, and we truly hope you would enjoy it.

Mission Statement: The goal of any business is to be successful but to end it there would be too easy for someone that loves what he does and is very good at it. Diamonds and what came to follow was such a fascination that I realized that the financial success became secondary because even more importantly I love to write about and talk about those pretty little bobbles that are more commonly called diamonds, gems, jewelry, fine watches and glittering metals. In the last 38 years of exposing myself to many people in the business it came to my attention that many of these so-called business people are not interested in the product at all but rather the profit that comes from it. The vast misrepresentation of the many products involved today is rampant and I pride myself in clearly separating myself with accurate information regardless of what I think the outcome will be. Truth will always prevail! At Lovelady Diamond we promise to make your experience as rewarding, professional and timely as possible. After 33 years our experience and knowledge has allowed us to be on the cutting edge of competiveness as buyers and sellers in the industry. With no pressure to buy or sell we just ask for your trust that we've always believed should be earned and not presumed.

High Wycombe Lions Club, founded in 1972, is part of the Lions Clubs International, an association of 1.31 million Members in more than 46,000 Clubs, located in 205 countries. Lions Clubs International began in 1917 as the dream of a Chicago businessman who believed that local business clubs should expand their horizons, from purely professional concerns to the betterment of their communities and the world at large. The association network of men and women work together to answer the needs that challenge communities across the world. Members of High Wycombe Lions Club predominantly serve our local community based in and around High Wycombe. Equally importantly members enjoy an interesting and varied series of social activities. All the money we collect has to be used for good causes; the overheads of the Lions Club International is met by the subscriptions of Members. 15 local pub quizzes over 3 months culminating in a grand final, which was sponsored by Grant & Stone allowing the Lions to present an initial cheque of £2500 to Wycombe First Responders. This will be presented to Wycombe First Responders as part of a wider fundraising project to raise around £15,000 to deliver a new ambulance which is urgently needed in the Wycombe & District area. Community First Responders are urgently needed to help save more lives in Denham, Gerrard’s Cross, Amersham, Chesham, High Wycombe, Beaconsfield, Langley and other areas of Buckinghamshire. The volunteer responders are called by South Central Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust (SCAS) to attend potentially life-threatening incidents, such as cardiac arrests or strokes – often helping to save lives of people in their local communities by being at a scene very quickly in those crucial first few moments before paramedics arrive.
I’ve been fortunate enough to embark on an epic culinary experience, not once or twice but three times at Golf’s Restaurant. From the appetizers to the dessert, I could not find fault with the presentation, quality, or level of service. Staff here really know their steak, and especially have the timing down to an art when it comes to bring out each dish. Be prepared to spend upwards of $60+ per person but it’s well worth it.
Elephant tourism has long been a feature of trips to Thailand or the Indian subcontinent. Whether it’s riding them, washing them in the river, or merely posing with their trunk wrapped around your arm, photos of these magnificent beasts have become such staple of gap yah Instagram accounts that they’re almost beyond parody. But while it’s easy to laugh at the clichés, there’s a much more serious side to the industry. One that’s increasingly being laid bare as new research emerges. In 2014 Intrepid Travel worked with World Animal Protection to commission one such report. The findings made for pretty shocking reading, highlighting the systematic abuse by mahout (elephant tamers) upon their elephants in the name of tourism. It found “elephants suffering in terrible conditions, taken young from the wild, separated from their familial groups, broken again and again using sharp hooks and other tools, chained up at night and denied good nutrition,” Aaron Hocking, Intrepid Travel’s UK managing director, told us. Since 2014, over 200 travel companies, including the big shots like Thomas Cook have slashed elephant rides from their itineraries. And judging from the glut of encouraging articles on Google warning about the dangers of elephant riding, word, at least in the West, is spreading about the objective harm and danger elephants are put through when giving rides. But while there may be heightened awareness, there’s also a misconception that things have changed for the better, says Chiara Vitali from World Animal Protection. “There’s been a growth of 30 percent in five years of the number of captive elephants in Thailand,” she says. “Whilst there has been a modest increase in the number of elephants living in better welfare conditions, this has been overshadowed by the far bigger increase in number of elephants living in poor conditions (probably largely driven by the growth in tourism from countries like China)”. To effect change, we must understand that elephant abuse is the result of supply and demand. “If demand dries up, so does the financial incentive,” explains Aaron Hocking. “Demand reduction from the public is key to changing policies and practices of both travel companies and the wildlife attractions on the ground,” adds Chiara Vitali from World Animal Protection. As well as these international organisations, there has long been a contingent of community figureheads pushing for change. In Thailand, for instance, a country traditionally associated with elephant riding, Lek Chailert has been spearheading a movement towards ethical elephant tourism since the early noughties. She is the founder of the Save The Elephant Foundation, and in 2001 was awarded the Ford Foundation’s ‘Hero of the Planet’ award. In 2005, Time Magazine named her one of their ‘Heroes of Asia’. The surge in publicity surrounding the welfare of elephants over the last few years has raised the profile of Lek’s work, and given it more of an international context. And gratifyingly, she’s not alone – others are campaigning for elephant tourism without the harming interactive elements, like elephant riding or elephant bathing, all of which are highly stressful to the animals. In an ideal world, PETA’s Elisa explains, “former mahouts can be given priority for employment at these facilities, so there would be no loss of livelihood.” As things stand, the quality of life for old-style mahouts is already seriously challenging. “Mahouts receive low pay for a high-risk job, with many suffering injuries and having little financial security,” says Aaron Hocking. Abusive elephant handling was, sadly, part and parcel of traditional mahout work. The bull hook has been used to control elephants for hundreds of years, dating back to when elephants were commonly used for logging. However, as Intrepid’s Aaron states: “We don’t believe tradition is an excuse for elephant riding.” And in any case, according to Chiara from World Animal Protection, elephants in tourism are exposed to tougher conditions than they ever were when used for logging: “The rise of an elephant tourism industry is very different from how elephants were traditionally kept,” she says. As demand for abusive rides decreases – at least in the West – more mahouts are catching onto the Lek Chailert formula. But there’s still more work to do. Much of the effort so far has been led by not-for-profits and tourism protection bodies. “World Animal Protection works closely with leaders within the travel industry to demonstrate the strong demand for elephant-friendly (observation-only) tourism,” Chiara Vitali explains. At observation-only attractions like the Phuket Elephant Sanctuary, Save The Elephant Foundation and Happy Elephant Valley, animals roam free and aren’t shackled up at night. They aren’t allowed to be directly interacted with under any circumstances, and under these conditions, older elephants who were privy to abuse are able to thrive in old age. One challenge is the seedy underbelly of ‘ethical’ elephant ‘sanctuaries’ mistreating elephants but fooling the public into believing they are getting an ethical experience. “It’s worth noting that many self-proclaimed “elephant sanctuaries” are nothing more than glorified circuses,” insists Elisa from PETA. World Animal Protection takes a slightly more nuanced view. Chiara claims that, at properly ethical sanctuaries, “people can have the incredible experience of watching elephants behave naturally – free from suffering and exploitation”. So what’s the answer? Well, if you do want to see these majestic creatures, beware of ‘sanctuaries’ offering elephant bathing, feeding or riding experiences, or where elephants are confined to tight spaces. If in doubt, steer clear completely. And if any of your friends start posting selfies with the animals? Make sure you mention the elephant in the room. Intrepid Travel organise fairly priced trips combining ethical elephant experiences, visit their website for more information. Adam Bloodworth is a freelance writer, based in London.

One of the many privileges of this job is I get to showcase terrific author who have become friends. Today’s another one of those days. Meet Suzanne Rogerson, author of the new novel Visions of Zarua. Suzanne lives in Middlesex, England, and wrote her first novel at the age of twelve. She discovered the fantasy genre in her late teens and has never looked back. Giving up work to raise a family gave her the impetus to take her attempts at novel writing beyond the first draft, and she is lucky enough to have a husband who supports her dream – even if he does occasionally hint that she might think about getting a “proper” job one day. Dan: Welcome! Tell us: who is your target audience, Suzanne? Suzanne: I don’t know many people who read fantasy, so I’d hoped to write a story that those unfamiliar with the genre would still enjoy, as well as those of us who already love fantasy. Judging by the reviews so far, I’ve definitely achieved my aim. Awesome! And what about actually writing that first novel? Many authors struggle with that. Did you? The biggest challenge was getting the structure of the novel right. It’s difficult keeping track of a story that straddles two timelines but I was determined that the reader wouldn’t be confused at any point. Using the first person perspective for those chapters that were in the past and third person for the rest of the novel really helped to make that transition clear. I loved writing Jago’s scenes in first person but it wasn’t a viewpoint I’m used to writing in so that too was a challenge. Jago? Sounds interesting. What was the inspiration for the characters in Visions Of Zarua? Good. Then you’re doing it right. I get to know their story, their history and their characteristics as I write. Then as they develop I can go back and add in the odd detail or slip in a flashback of their past. It may be a long-winded method that requires more editing, but I love editing so that’s not an issue for me. I have tried writing character profiles beforehand, but they are flat and one-dimensional with none of the emotional involvement I get from writing the scenes of the novel. Man, I hate editing. Maybe you can tell me your secret. Meanwhile, did you draw from real life at all while crafting the story? I drew a lot from my love of nature and the outdoors. Having a hunt mistress who is more at home in the wilderness allowed me to add in the little details I love about the natural world, and hopefully made Paltria seem more real to my readers. A hunt mistress? I think I need one of those! Well, you recently started a blog tour. Tell us where and when you’ll be appearing and how it’s done so far. The best thing by far about the blog tour was the positive response I received from other bloggers. I had originally arranged for a company to run a one day book blitz for me, but that fell through. After the initial disappointment I decided to run my own. Smart. What was that like? I put out the call via my blog and twitter, and within a matter of days had enough yes’s to fill two weeks! Holy cow! Why didn’t I think of that? I am totally stealing that idea. I’d only planned to run the tour for a week, so I was overwhelmed with the replies. Trying to come up with original content for two weeks was hard, so I settled on using some of my own photography with small excerpts from the book. I was really pleased with the results. The blog tour took a lot of work before and during, so if I did another one, I would do it either before or during the release of my next novel as part of my marketing plan. It zaps too much time away from writing otherwise. Also smart. So? What was your conclusion? Do you recommend blog tours? Wholeheartedly. I’ve made some new blogging friends and Visions of Zarua has received some great reviews because of it. Fantastic. Give us places to see where you went and where you’ll be. Here are the links to all the blogs that were involved in my tour. Give us the blurb and where can my readers get this intriguing book of yours. Smashwords Has a 50% sale. Only $2.00 throughout July. Goodreads Giveaway ends 24th July. Still time to win a signed paperback copy here. Okay, and what else can I bother you for? How about a favorite passage from Visions of Zarua? Varnia took a step towards the trees, but he grabbed her arm. ‘Wait! Let me check it’s safe.’ Paddren reached out his senses to scan the area and didn’t loosen his grip until he was certain no one was waiting to ambush them. Varnia and her hound raced ahead. Flint led them straight to the bushes under the trees, to the exact spot where Paddren imagined Kalesh had focused his energy. ‘Come and look at this,’ Varnia called. As he joined her, Varnia shuffled out the way to reveal the disturbed ground she’d been studying. Paddren stared down at the set of huge footprints. Immediately the outline in the soil began to blur. He shut his eyes, but even behind closed lids, the beast was waiting for him… the beast from his nightmares. He snapped his eyes open and looked at Varnia, relieved to see her still examining the footprints. Flint was fighting to get closer, so Varnia let him through. The hound growled as he sniffed the footprints. Flint sniffed the footprints again and then the area around them. With his nose to the ground, he moved further into the trees, working in widening circles until he returned and sat down next to Varnia, whimpering. ‘That’s strange, he can’t find the scent.’ She followed a similar ritual to the dog, searching for a clue Flint’s powerful nose might’ve missed. Paddren leant against the nearest tree and surveyed the clearing while he waited for Varnia to accept there were no other footprints. BRILLIANT! I hope my readers take advantage of your generosity and your helpful blog tour information. (I know I will.) Thanks so much for dropping by! Suzanne Rogerson loves gardening and has a Hebe (shrub) fetish. She enjoys cooking with ingredients from the garden, and regularly feeds unsuspecting guests vegetable-based cakes. Give her book a look! Thanks for featuring me, Dan. It’s been a pleasure. It was my pleasure! Wishing you continued success with the book! She will be psyched to hear that! Thanks!
The people of Carmine pull together in service to their neighbors throughout the year. One of the main events of the year in Carmine is the annual Firemen’s Feast. This fundraising event helps cover the cost of providing a fire department for this community. There are large numbers of people who give of their time, energy and resources to make this event happen each year. In order to provide a time of worship on Sunday morning for these faithful servants MLLC brings church to them. A brief worship service with Holy Communion will be offered this Sunday, July 19, at about 7:30 a.m. at the Carmine VFD fire house. (We will also gather at MLLC for our usual time of worship at 9:00 a.m. this Sunday.) All people who will be serving at the Firemen’s Feast Sunday morning are especially invited to participate in this time of prayer, Word and Sacrament. We are expecting 50+ participants this year. Most of the people at this service are the cooks for the chicken, but the service is not limited to those at the firehouse. If you are going to be working at the dinner at Carmine Hall, please feel free to attend this 7:30 a.m. service at the Fire Station before you head over to prepare the hall for serving. The photo above is from last year’s service.
This webinar has been recorded and was originally held in May 2014 at HBM in Darmstadt, Germany. This video covers the nuts and bolts (literally and figuratively) of installing a torque sensor. We will discuss how to mount both the rotor and stator, the recommended coupling methods, how to properly align and balance a torque sensor and how to use the supplied calibration data sheet. Learn all the tips and tricks from HBM’s Mark Minda, who holds over 20 years of experience in repair, calibration and day-to-day use of torque sensors.
This paper addresses the emerging common movement toward proactive asset management for the nation’s infrastructure, in particular the water resources infrastructure (water, wastewater, and storm water treatment facilities, collection and distribution systems). Following decades of original capital investment, we now face a mounting financial burden to sustain that infrastructure. Appropriate renewal of assets before reaching “dire-need” is the objective of proactive asset management. Failure to renew the infrastructure will lead to greater violations of water quality standards and greater costs for appropriate mitigation. The job must begin now if the water resources infrastructure is to be sustained or improved to an appropriate level of quality. But, specifically what is to be done, in what order, by whom, and who pays for it? While many managers take the position that they must wait until circumstances are more favorable, the fact is that circumstances might not improve significantly. So, what to do?
Five years ago, a tropical depression formed in the Atlantic and began moving towards Florida. Later, it would become one of the worst hurricanes to hit the United States. On the day that the hurricane hit the Gulf Coast, my friend and colleague left Baghdad to return home. I watched her drive off into the hot, dusty Iraqi afternoon, went back inside to the tent that we had shared for a month. Her cot was empty. So was my heart. It was tough enough being embedded with the U.S. Army. But to do it solo, in the middle of a raging war? I began to feel sorry for myself until I heard the news from Louisiana. The next day, at the Camp Striker chow hall, I ran into Louisiana National Guard soldiers. The 256th Infantry Brigade Combat Team had been at war for a year, based at nearby Camp Liberty. They called their pad Tigerland. They had lost about 40 men. Each day, they had smelled the acrid fumes of bombs and ammunition, seen the worst of humanity. They were exhausted and so ready to go home. It should have been a happy few last days. Instead, it turned wretchedly bittersweet. They could not take their eyes off the television screens. Image after image of New Orleans under a 30-foot wall of water. One soldier recognized his block in the lower 9th ward; even thought he saw his house, just the rooftop visible in the footage. The excitement quickly turned to dread on his face. He sat stone cold at the table, not being able to say anything for a few minutes. Then: “Well, that’s where I used to live,” he said, running off to the AT&T phone trailer to see if he could check on his mama. I am sure his effort was in vain. New Orleans was dark. No lights, no phones. Nothing. Many of them wanted to get on a plane that instant so they could help their fellow Guardsmen with rescue efforts. In their last days in Iraq, a guilt gnawed at their hearts. Some felt lucky to be in Iraq. Life seemed like a series of terrible ironies at that moment. So cruel and unfair. I crawled back into my tent that night no longer wallowing in my loneliness. Just grateful to be have a home back in Atlanta. Grateful to be alive. I read a story on Slate a few days ago about the same brigade, back in Iraq, back in the chow hall glued to the TV screens. Only this time, it was oil instead of water.

After two games at the 2018 World Cup, Argentina was in serious trouble. With an aging team that lacked world class defenders, the Albiceleste managed just a draw with Iceland while eventual World Cup finalists Croatia reminded Argentina what it used to have in midfield with a dominating 3-0 win. The defeat put Argentina in a precarious position, needing a win on the final group stage day and some luck to go through into the knockout stage past Nigeria and Iceland. Now, a new book by Argentine journalist Ariel Senosiain could shed some light on what happened between the match against Croatia and Nigeria. According to Senosian’s digital book, called El Mundial es Historias, Lionel Messi and Javier Mascherano ordered a meeting with manager Jorge Sampaoli and his coaching staff, and it did not go down well. Messi was reportedly also upset with Sampaoli for the manager asking Messi who he thought should come on as a substitute during the match. “You asked me 10 times which players you wanted me to see on and which ones I didn’t and I never gave you a name,” Messi reportedly said. In the days following the defeat to Croatia, many reports emerged out of the Argentina camp that Messi had essentially organized a mutiny, and he was going to select the squad and tactical instructions. The team made the switch from a three-man backline to a more standard 4-4-2, and it delivered some better performances, even though Argentina’s defense was still shambolic, especially in the 4-3 defeat to France. With 15 members of the 23-man roster over the age of 30 and no head coach, the Argentina National Team is set for a huge upheavel, and there’s not much in terms of youth players who could replace the likes of Mascherano, Banega, Otamendi and of course Messi and Sergio Aguero in the lineup. These alleged quotes are just the beginning of what should be a messy year for Argentina, as it tries to get itself back on track, renewing its youth development and forming the next generation of Albiceleste stars.
Fred and Jam are reunited and ready to kick off more consistent retro content, albeit this one is only half retro. In this spoileriffic comparison podcast, the two delve into the development and content of the scrapped version of Resident Evil 2, dubbed Resident Evil 1.5 by the Internet, as well as the original full blown release. Then they move over to comparing the quality and content in this new remake. It’s a long ride and it’s highly recommended that you play the games first, but sit back and enjoy a horrifying trip through the Raccoon City police department and beyond. Something tells me if I ever play a RE game outside of 4, it will be the original 2, not this remake. From what I can tell by how Fred described the story, that “heart wrenching emotional family drama” was written by someone who never ever went through that himself, and was instead inspired by Hollywood movies. I reject on principle any story that does not feel genuinely human.

We visited Sagano & Arashiyama for strolling. It not only bamboo forest, but also store signs and menu, the scenery of town, everything was new. Our students could see the different angle of Kyoto from what they have already learned. They looked very tired of strolling around the area in the hot weather. Take good rest today and get the school days after fresh! We visited Shugakuin Imperial Villa and were divided into two groups to stroll. We really enjoyed the beautiful garden which is one of the examples representative of Japanese gardens. Visiting the garden in the fall or winter makes different impression. Why not give it a try again on some holiday? The summer short term course begins on July 11. Here the calendar and the schedule of weekly field trips & other attractive summer events are as the below. Let's enjoy your summer with studying Japanese and experiencing historical events in Kyoto!

You wouldn’t know that Case, who spends hours speeding up and down the ice at hockey practice, was anything other than an active little boy. But soon after he was born in 2001, his mother Leslie Haberstroh knew something wasn’t right. He couldn’t hold down his baby formula, and he was unable to pass his newborn stool or meconium. “It was the typical signs of Hirschsprung’s or a blockage,” said Leslie. Case was soon sent to UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh where he underwent a biopsy under the care of a team of doctors. After surgery, Case spent 3 weeks recovering in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. The doctors wanted to ensure that everything had gone properly with the procedure, that his intestines didn’t twist, and that he could keep formula down. After passing these tests, baby Case was sent home. Three months later, Case returned to UPMC Children’s for a second surgery called a pull-through. Since then, he hasn’t had any operations and only takes medication on an as-needed basis. Case participated in a research study at UPMC Children’s for nearly eight years in order to help other children with Hirschsprung’s disease. Case’s symptoms didn’t disappear totally, however. He still experiences abdominal discomfort, especially after eating. Still, Case says lunch is one of his favorite subjects at school. The discomfort, however, can cause missed class time, leaving him behind on instruction. Luckily, a few helpful teachers and Case’s determination to do well and keep up with his brother have allowed him to reach his goals. Both Case and Leslie know how hard it can be to send a young Hirschsprung’s patient off to school. That’s why Leslie wanted to raise awareness and offer support to families who were experiencing the same thing that she went through a few years earlier. The Haberstroh family wanted to raise awareness about Hirschsprung’s and offer support to other families who have children with the disease. To do this, Case decided to bring together hockey and Hirschsprung’s, two things close to his heart. In September 2014, the Haberstroh family organized the first annual “Hockey for Hirschsprung’s” youth ice hockey tournament. The goal was to raise awareness, raise money, and inspire other kids. Case wanted to show that it is possible to lead a normal life with the disease. “I can do lots of stuff that all my other friends can do,” Case said. The week-long event at the Belmont Complex in West Kittanning attracted 12 amateur teams for a round-robin tournament. The winners were presented with ice-like medals and a banner. The first annual event raised $3,500 for the Colorectal Center for Children. “I felt pretty good that I could give money to kids [with Hirschsprung’s],” said Case. Overall, the tournament was a success. The Haberstroh clan connected with 2 other families that had young kids with Hirschsprung’s. They shared tips and advice, but most importantly support. “So much support came out of this,” Leslie said. The 2nd Annual Hockey For Hirschsprung’s tournament is scheduled for August 26-30 & September 2-6, 2015 and is now fielding 24 teams. Today, the hockey-loving teenager gets more ice time than hospital time, and he and his family have turned their love of the sport in to a chance to help other children suffering from Hirschsprung’s. In the future, Case hopes to go to a “good college” and play on their hockey team. His mother Leslie knows that “whatever he does, he will be successful. He’s very driven.” These days, nothing seems to be holding Case back. For an appointment or consultation, Contact the Colorectal Center for Children.
I hope they serve beer in hell is a book that stats almost all the terrible things and great things that can come out of engaging yourself in a lot of drinking. The main character Tucker Max is a great writer. I mostly enjoying reading his books because he tells the truth. Every story he writes is completely true and thats what makes hims so hilarious. If it wasnt true then it wouldnt be as funny, but knowing that some of the things he says happens is what really makes the story.
Our best selling shape and style of bag is the bucket, so far. Comes in four lovely colours: burgundy, black, navy and grey. We made this mini one because it is really cute.

The top handle is made of a reflective paracord just because details like that make us happy.
The internet as we know today has become very generic. Although that is has become an incredible tool giving the possibility to millions of internet users worldwide to search any and all kind of information, there is a lot of confusing and malicious information that is available. Consequently, it has become more and more difficult for companies and brand owners to differentiate themselves in the eyes of the internet user from the other of millions of domain names that have no primary or secondary meaning. In many cases internet users do not really know anymore whether they are dealing with a true company with all kinds of negative experiences as a result Also if you look at some of existing gTLDs that were set up with an initial purpose to serve the corporate market, you can see that that purpose has diluted. With .ltd TLD we as the Applicant want to change that experience, bringing back the true meaning of a specific TLD that will allow companies that are registered within a specific region to be able to register their company names within the .ltd TLD, making it clearer for the user that he is dealing with the corporate market. As such, this specific TLD will provide companies the opportunity to differentiate themselves from any other TLD due to the fact that the Applicant will ensure and enhance restricted policies (i.e. only companies registered within the Commonwealth countries, Ireland, China, Hong Kong and⁄or Brazil will be allowed to apply for a domain name). The result will be a genuine, safe and secure TLD that will not tolerate any abuses or misuse of domain names or websites and will ensure that all companies that apply for a domain name do indeed meet the requirements of the policies as laid down by the Applicant. In addition companies that were not entitled to register their company names as a domain name due to unavailability will now have the opportunity to do so. In addition, the Applicant is convinced that an .ltd TLD will be an added value to the internet community as a whole and to the internet user in specific. As the internet domain space- as we know today- will entirely change the internet users will search the internet on a whole different level. The internet will no longer exist primarily of “.com” domain names, but the domain name space will become more segregated. Consequently, the Applicant truly believes that the .ltd TLD will provide an added value by setting up and managing a TLD that will only allow companies that are registered in the Commonwealth countries, Ireland, China, Hong Kong and⁄or Brazil to apply for a domain name. The Applicant wants to ensure that all registrants have a link within the TLD, as the term ʺltdʺ is used by the majority of companies that are registered under the laws and regulations of Commonwealth countries, Ireland, China, Hong Kong and⁄or Brazil.

Those teaching interests have been intertwined with Jon’s impact work on the Roman army and onTrajan’s column.
Holy abseiling Batman - this is a long way up! The new Royal Alexandra Children’s Hospital in Eastern Road had some very special visitors this weekend. The hospital which was previously located in Dyke Road, opened in June this year and is a state-of-the-art design costing £36 million. It is one of only seven dedicated to paediatric care in the UK. The nine-storey building has been designed in the shape of an ark and includes beds for up to 100 patients, 15 outpatient consulting rooms, three operating theatres and a cancer care day centre. So imagine everyone’s surprise, not least of all the young patients in the wards, when Batman and Robin were to be seen abseiling up the walls. Batman (aka Ian Mitchell) and his trusty side-kick Robin (aka Wayne Ascott) are part of the maintence company that keep the building ‘ship shape’. They dressed up for the day just to give the children a treat and make them smile. Well done the dynamic duo.
Extract from Escott Reid’s new book Strengthening the World Bank being published in September by the Adlai Stevenson Institute, Chicago, III., U.S.A., $7.50, £3, or Rs. 40. Mr. Reid was director of the South Asia and Middle East Department of the World Bank from 1962 to 1965. “There is general agreement that the purpose of aid from the World Bank Group and other agencies is to make it easier for the governments of developing countries to pursue sensible development policies. The disagreement is over who is to be the arbiter of what are and what are not sensible development policies. There are two extreme theoretical positions. One is that the government of the poorer country should be the sole arbiter; that it alone can be considered by an international agency or by another government as the interpreter of the country’s system of values and development priorities, its social goals, and the aspirations of its people; that aid agencies must not question that government’s decisions but must assist it to carry them out expeditiously and efficiently. The other extreme position is that the aid agencies know what is best. “Neither of these two positions will come within the scope of practical politics in the foreseeable future. Both of them are non-starters. Until aid on concessional terms can be financed largely from sources other than taxes imposed by the governments of rich countries on their citizens, these governments will be compelled by the realities of the domestic political process to adopt policies on aid which will enable them to convince the taxpayers that they are making reasonable efforts to ensure that the aid financed out of their taxes is being well used. This applies to their own bilateral aid programs and to the multilateral agencies they contribute to, such as the World Bank Group, the regional banks, and the UN Development Program. As for the other extreme position, sentiment in the poorer countries limits both the willingness and the ability of their governments to accept intervention by aid agencies in their affairs. They are compelled by the realities of their domestic political processes to adopt policies which enable them to assure their citizens that they are not sacrificing the independence of their country in return for aid. “Proponents of all the schools of thought on international aid are compelled to accept, however reluctantly, the need to apply some system of rationing to the flow of aid money, since this money is scarce, and the softer it is the scarcer it is…. “What is at issue is not the need to establish a rationing system but the nature of the rationing system and, in particular, the extent of intervention in the affairs of aid-receiving countries which it entails. Those, both in the poorer countries and in the rich countries, who favor a relatively high level of intervention… believe, however, that aid agencies should limit their intervention to broad and central aspects of development policy, and express opinions on these only after penetrating investigation. Aid agencies, in striving to come to agreement with the poorer country, should make all reasonable concessions to reach agreement. If a reasonable compromise cannot be reached, the agencies should, in the interest of the poorer country, substantially reduce the flow of aid. Those who favor intervention ask whether it is to the advantage of the people of an aid-receiving country that aid agencies accept the development priorities of the government even when it is obvious that the government is assigning high priority to prestige projects which promise less economic and social returns than other, less ostentatious, projects…. “Many who would most vehemently deny that they are interventionists believe that since international efforts to help developing countries will be of no avail unless those countries make major changes in their political, social, and economic policies and institutions, aid should depend on the extent to which a country meets such performance criteria as equitable income distribution, land and tax reforms, effective trade and exchange rate policies, limitation of military expenditures, and the promotion of social justice…. Excerpts from a speech by Richard H. Demuth. Chairman of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, to the Association of Directors of International Agriculture Programs in Raleigh, N.C., U.S.A., June 14, 1973. “In the early days of the postwar development assistance effort, it was the conventional wisdom that what the developing countries needed to modernize their agriculture was not so much additional research as the organization of adequate extension services which could deliver to the farmers of the Third World the scientific expertise already available in the developed world. It was assumed that appropriate technology already existed that could be readily transferred from north to south. Experience has shown that, to a large extent, this was a false assumption—in other words, that appropriate agricultural production technologies for the poorer countries must for the most part be developed within and not outside the ecological zones in which those countries lie. “This meant emphasizing research and training within the Third World. A good deal of effort was then put, and is still being put, into the development of strong national research programs—and in a few countries notable progress has been made: Mexico, Colombia, Chile, India, and Thailand are outstanding examples. But moving on a country-by-country basis, particularly with the limited human and financial resources available, promised to be a slow procedure, wholly inadequate to the urgency of the world’s food production needs. “So, under the leadership of the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, an alternative strategy was developed: namely, to assemble a critical mass of scientific talent in a few places within the Third World to launch a multidisciplinary attack sharply focused upon the most urgent technological problems facing agricultural production in the developin countries. The international agricultural research and training center was the means devised to implement this alternative strategy. “The family of international centers now numbers six, with one associate member. The full members of the family are the International Rica Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines; the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in Mexico; the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), for the lowland tropics of Africa, in Nigeria; the International Center of Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), for the lowland tropics of Latin America, in Colombia; the International Potato Center (CIP) in Peru; and the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), with special responsibility for sorghums, millets, chick peas, and pigeon peas, in India. The “associate” member of the family is the Asian Vegetable Research Center located in Taiwan. “The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research was formed in 1971, when it became clear that the base of both financial and technical support for the centers need to be broadened beyond the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations and the U.S. and Canadian Governments which, up to then, had provided almost all the finance and back-stopping. The basic purpose of the Consultative Group, which is co-sponsored by the FAO, IBRD, and UNDP, is to mobilize such broadened support. Essentially, it seeks agreement among its members as to what agricultural research programs should be considered as having priority in the allocation of scarce development assistance funds, on the extent of the funds which should be provided each year, and on how the burden of financing might be shared. As a result of invitations issued by the three co-sponsors, some 13 donor governments, 7 international and regional development assistance agencies, and 4 private and public foundations have become members of the Group. The Group also has as members 10 developing countries, representing the 5 major developing regions of the world; these 10 LDC’s among them occupy 5 seats at the Consultative Group table. In its mixed composition of public and private organizations, of donor and recipient countries, and of regional and international agencies, the Consultative Group is a unique institution. “The Consultative Group has no funds of its own nor has it any authority to make decisions binding on its members. Yet, despite these limitations and despite the size and diversity of its membership, the Group has thus far succeeded in reaching very general agreement on the issues with which it has grappled. Perhaps the best indication of this is that funding for the international centers rose from $9 million for 1971 to $15 million for 1972 and to about $24 million for 1973. In addition, ICRISAT was created in 1972 under the aegis of the Consultative Group and this year is likely to see the addition of a seventh member of the family—ILRAD—an International Laboratory for Research on Animal Diseases, to be located near Nairobi in Kenya. “To the extent that the Consultative Group has been successful thus far, it is due, in my judgment, principally to two factors. The first is the existence of an excellent Technical Advisory Committee, popularly known as TAC, composed of six scientists from the developed countries and six from the developing countries, who meet under the chairmanship of Sir John Crawford of Australia. The TAC, the Secretariat
Fabulous Fyst Double Review Disclaimer! - I watched the Blu-Ray version of this season, and the TV version of the second. Also, I wrote the first review before watching the second season. I just didn't post it, because school things, ok? ok. Here we go. The Introduction - Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is a show about a boy Kodaka who has naturally blond hair, and a mean looking face transferring to a new school. His appearance and inability to socialize because of it keeps him from making a single friend. One day he overhears a girl talking to herself, and finds himself stumbling into the Neighbors club a club with the sole goal of making new friends! The Neighbors Club becomes a fun collection of misfits whose activities make up this show. The Fabulous - The humor and character interaction elevate this show from just a regular harem styled anime to another level. It levies the social inadequacies that the members of this club have for some great laughs, but importantly it doesn't ever make you feel like you're laughing at these people which is great. The relationship between Yozora and Sena in particular is great and rich with material that the show exploits. The other thing that this show does well is it's side characters, especially Sena's father who's used for quite a few good laughs. Nice variation of tropes and some light deconstruction of the genre, makes for a pretty good watch. The Meh - The fan service in the version I watched was pretty out of control in a few episodes. It was only a couple of episodes, but when it showed up boy was I surprised! Maria the club's advisor is given almost nothing to do throughout this season other than eat and say "poop" or "poopy vampire" or something else poop related. which had it's moments, but meh. The Unfabulous - Kodaka is dense. Like seriously dense. It's almost as if it's intentional. Oh and sometimes I have a disconnect with the characters, I find myself thinking "you don't need to be popular or have friends to do this, you guys are just being stupid." The ending didn't feel satisfying at all. They must have known they were going to be getting a second season, but if I were watching this live I would have been so pissed. The Introduction - Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai Next continues the adventures of The Neighbors Club. More craziness comes to light and we learn some revealing backstory for some of the cast. This season dips it's toes into a little more serious tone, but only slightly. The change is nice for some of the subtext that was placed into the first season. The big highlight of the season is that the club is making a movie for their cultural festival. The Fabulous - The humor and character interaction are still the highlights of the show, but this time it's not Yozora and Sena that steal the show, it's Rika. She is now one of my favorite characters in a rom-com ever. It was good to see a character behave like a real person would (Rika, act normal, what are you talking about?) Rika puts on a mask, and behaves differently around everyone else, except for when she's alone with Kodaka in order to protect herself. And she's brutally honest with him, which because he's dense is a good thing. Too bad she's not one of the main two heroines, I think she should be the one he ends up with. Some of the other characters do well in this season as well. Sena and Yukimura (Who I don't think I mentioned at all in the previous review, but I don't want to spoil anything) get great parts. The Meh - Maria is still one dimensional, while one of the main two heroines feels under used this season, Yozora felt stagnant for as big of a role as she had in season one. Some of the episodes felt rehashed from the previous season with tweaks to what was going on. Where I could see them saying the differences highlight the differences in the characters as they grow, it felt recycled more than once. The Unfabulous - Again the ending didn't feel satisfying at all. This is becoming a trend with this show, but I must say it's better than the first one, but it clearly isn't the end this series deserves. I wonder if a third season is coming? The Conclusion - This was a somewhat more serious season and some of the revelations in the final few episodes seriously surprised me. (Rika, looking at you) I think I enjoyed the humor more in season one and the characters more in season two. I give this season 4/5 trains as well.

This is your direct communication channel for FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions). In case you don’t find a FAQ that suits your questions, kindly feel free to contact us and enable us to extend our FAQ. QUESTION ON PAYMENTS: Besides the site service payment for inventors to register an «inventoo ad», as for seekers to «seek inventoo» and acquire the inventor contact, are there any fees or success fees due to inventoo on the potential business? No. This is a clean model. There are no hidden or success fees due by the inventor or the seeker to inventoo. QUESTION FROM INVENTORS: Will I be contacted by a company seeking innovation? You can expect to be contacted, yes. It mostly depends on your inventoo quality ad and on the invention potential/opportunity that you are promoting. QUESTION FROM SEEKER: After I buy one or multiple inventors’ contacts, am I expected to contact them and are they expecting to be contacted? Buying a contact is your decision to access the person behind the invention to establish contact and potentially make business. You contact who you want, if you want and when you want.

The Harvey Gillingham Salvers were played for at East Devon Golf Club, writes Paul Willoughby. Played in fours, this was a pairs, better-ball Stableford from the white tees with 90 per cent handicap allowance. Wossat? You play in pairs and the better ball is scored. OK? For some, the extra ingredient of playing with a partner adds a spark to the game and the leading sparkling exponents of the competition were father and son team, Paul and Robin Murray, who won the Salvers with a stunning net 60. Well done, Murrays. Second was the team of Tony Beck and Robert Barnes with a net score of 62 and third were Julian Turnbull and Bill Peaker with 63. Also in the prizes were Donald Peek and Alastair Mackenzie-Ross, also with 63. There were 53 pairs and twelve had twos; Guy Peters and David Blick both has two of them at the fourth and the 10th. Well done all.

Video, Tel-Rumeida, Hebron. Jan. 5, 2014. By Youth Against Settlements. The plundering of Palestine continues. Under the guise of archaeological digs, what the Defense Ministry’s Civil Administration cynically calls “rescue evacuations,” Israel is expanding its settlement in the heart of Hebron to include the ancient site of Tel Rumeida. The settlers depict the dig as free of any political influence. But like any project carried out in the territories in general and Hebron in particular, the dig is above all a political act. It is an expansion of the Jewish hold on the heart of the West Bank’s most explosive Palestinian city and it follows Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s declaration of opposition to the relocation of its Jewish settlement. In recent years the West Bank settlers have discovered the hidden benefits of archaeology. This ostensibly neutral discipline allows them to expropriate not only territory but also its historical narrative, fixing it in place from the Jewish perspective while disregarding other archaeological strata and cultures. The authorities – from the Israel Antiquities Authority to the Israel Nature and Parks Authority, from the Israel Defense Forces to the Prime Minister’s Office – happily cooperate. ….. Israeli authorities have declared as archaeological sites places that have served the Palestinian residents for years. The political use of finds is not new to Israeli archaeology, which to a great extent owes its beginnings to the need for physical proof of the Jewish claim to the land. But over the years, with the strengthening of the state, archaeology has shed its political dictates and become more professional. The right’s political exploitation of archaeology not only jeopardizes U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry’s efforts to forge a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians but also threatens to turn the discipline itself from a scientific tool into a mouthpiece for propaganda. The excavations began last Sunday. The video above was recorded by Youth Against Settlements and downloaded on YouTube the same day. Titled “new settlements in Hebron” and the location is Tel-Rumieda. See the soldiers arresting and dragging people away, with settlers ready and waiting. Hebron is so pointless. It’s like iron age Judaism. “I continued to feel helpless, but I also felt I had to do something. I started carrying boxes of produce out of the way of the bulldozers. I saved maybe 12 crates of produce from being crushed. I began confronting soldiers. In a loud voice, I asked them if they were proud of what they were doing, if this is peace, if this is what they want Israel to become. I shouted, “Baruch hashem Adonai” (Blessed be the name of the Lord). The soldiers tried their best to ignore me, but I am sure they heard me. I ignored their commands for me to leave. One soldier spit at me, so I walked right up to him and invited him to spit on me. He declined the offer. Three soldiers aimed their guns at and moved toward a group of Palestinian bystanders. It looked to me like they were going to shoot. I quickly jumped in front of the soldiers, raised my hands in the air and shouted, “Shoot me, shoot me, go ahead and shoot me.” The soldiers immediately left. A tank came roaring toward me, its big gun barrel aimed at me. I raised my hands in the air in prayer, and shouted, “Shoot, shoot, Baruch hashem adonai.” The tank stopped within inches of me. I then knelt in the street in prayer, with my hands raised. I felt alone, weak, helpless. I could only cry out to God. Later this afternoon I went back to Al Manara and watched shop owners dig through the huge piles of rubble, trying to salvage what they could. What could I say? The Israeli military had put all of Hebron under total curfew today, saying they were looking for terrorists. Now I wonder if there really were terrorists hidden among the apples and oranges. Or, are the Israeli soldiers committing acts of terrorism against the civilian population of Hebron? ‘The petals of trying to achieve peace’ – Kerry does have that faded look sometimes.

[Mix engineer] Anyone who records and mixes professionally has done this at least once in their career—you tweak a snare or vocal track to perfection only to discover later that the EQ was bypassed the whole time. Or you were tweaking a different track. And if you’ve been mixing and playing around with … whether you’re a professional or just a hobbyist, if you’ve been doing this for a few years and you haven’t done that, then you’re lying. Yet you were certain you heard a change! Human auditory memory and perception are extremely fragile, and expectation bias and placebo effect are much stronger than people care to admit.
Overlooking its obvious flaw, Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 was one heck of a smartphone with a terrific display. At the time, renowned smartphone display expert and DisplayMate President Dr. Raymond M. Soneira found the flagship to have the most innovative and high performance display of any handset. That’s some stiff competition to tackle but according to Soneira, Samsung has done just that with the Note 7’s successor. In a report on the matter, Soneira notes that the Galaxy S8 steals the crown as the most innovative and high performance smartphone display they’ve ever tested in the lab. Soneira found that the Galaxy S8 matches or sets new smartphone display records for highest peak brightness (1,020 nits), largest native color gamut (113 percent DCI-P3 and 142 percent sRGB / Rec.709), highest contrast rating in ambient light (227), highest (infinite) contrast ratio and lowest screen reflectance (4.5 percent), just to name a few. The screen expert recalls that the first notable OLED smartphone they looked at, the Google Nexus One, came in last place in their 2010 smartphone display shootout. In the span of just seven years, mobile OLED technology now has a commanding first place lead on the industry and continues forging ahead. The culmination of that is the Galaxy S8, the first in a new generation of OLED smartphones. Samsung is setting the stage for 2017 flagships as they’ll all likely use full screen display designs with flexible OLED technology. Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones go on sale April 21.

Overwatch, PUBG, CS:GO, Quake Champions, Killing Floor 2... the volume and variety of great first-person shooters has never been greater. Don't look now, but right now might be the best time ever for multiplayer FPSes. I'm old enough to have experienced the [to the tune of Bryan Adams] 'FPSummer of Ninety-Nine' that gave us, egad, Quake III, Unreal Tournament, Team Fortress Classic, and the beginning of Counter-Strike. I think 2017 surpasses that. An Arma mod on steroids is the most popular FPS on Steam. PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is a story generator that balances intense firefights with goofing around. It's a 100-person free-for-all on a massive map that also respects your time. This week PUBG is running its first major tournament at Gamescom, with a $350,000 prize pool. Even with PUBG alongside it, Arma 3—an intricate and often demanding sim—averages about 22,000 concurrent players daily. That's five times the playerbase it had at launch in 2013. Blizzard's first FPS is colorful, competitive, and inclusive. But maybe most noteworthy is the tenacity and transparency with which Blizzard has iterated on Overwatch over time: it's been patched more than 120 times since launch, with seven seasonal events so far. Investment money is pouring into Blizzard's Overwatch League, which will hopefully lay the groundwork for stable team rosters and great tournaments. Tribes isn't dead, it was just sleeping. Valve's support for CS:GO has been inconsistent, but the shooter has nevertheless cemented itself as an insanely deep competitive game. You could spend months working on your grenade technique alone. With its massive tournaments and a little help from online gambling, CS:GO has paved the way for all other FPS' esports scenes. Quake is back. Even with a free-to-play business model, rentable characters, and 'ultimate' abilities attached to each champion, Quake Champions bunnyhops and talks like a pure Quake game. One of the biggest game publishers in the world made a multiplayer-only, PC-first, tactical FPS and has supported it well for two years. Rainbow Six Siege has 2.3M daily players on all platforms. One decade after Halo 2, Destiny 2 is coming to PC. Tripwire and Antimatter Games are quietly making some of the best FPSes on this list. Killing Floor 2, which just ran a great summer event, deserves some sort of blood-soaked Emmy for its gore system and gun animations. Rising Storm 2: Vietnam represents one of the best midpoints between authenticity and accessibility, continuing the series' ambitious focus on asymmetry. Battlefield 1, with easily the best infantry combat in the series, chugs along with paid expansions. March's Day of Infamy is a worthy successor to Day of Defeat, with great co-op to boot. Unreal Tournament is being remade as a unique collaboration between modders and Epic. Expect a major update to Team Fortress 2 when it turns 10 on October 10. Call of Duty: WWII is getting a beta on PC. 20 years after GoldenEye came out on Nintendo 64, the best version of it exists on PC and is maintained by a team of passionate fans. It's free. Most of these games are funded by cosmetic microtransactions that don't affect gameplay, rather than expansions or map packs that would fragment the player base. The 144hz monitors you should play these games on are getting cheaper. I'm accepting counter-arguments in the comments.
Maintaining of engines is important to get the best performance out of an engine. When you drive the engine you are partly responsible for maintenance during stationary at depots. small workshops are direct accessible for drivers to perform small repairing and restorations. The workshop is also responsible for the engine as well where the engine is based.
Hey, wanna see my mesh. "adding 3D effect to web.." Photo of original teapot being modeled. Wouldn't it be nice if there was a simple way of taking photographs of objects and magically transforming them into 3D objects? Well D Sculptor isn't it, but it does do a darn good job if you're willing to put in some work. D Sculptor is a new product from a new company called D Vision Works Limited in the UK. It was created by people with a whole bunch of photogrammetry experience and responsible for Geometra a previously reviewed product. D Sculptor doesn't work by finding corresponding points of objects in photographs like most of these types of programs. Rather you find corresponding points of a reference set of points, marks on a table and then you outline the object in each of the photographs. If you have a lot of photographs this can get quite tedious but quality is never easy to obtain. Object after outlining and mesh generation. Final 3D object with extracted texture applied. D Sculptor costs £500 (UK pound sterling) which is approximately $723 (US Dollars), it's not cheap but for a highly specialized modeling program like this, it's not bad either. Position the object you want to model on a dot pattern. Take photos of the object from a number of different angles. Import these photographs into D Sculptor. Point out the dots on the dot pattern in each photo. Mark out the outline of the object in each photo. Let D Sculptor calculate the 3-D model for you. Export the 3-D model for use with other software packages as required. Marking the dot patterns is no big deal and just a tad tedious. Outlining the objects, as you might imagine, could be a horrendous task. It's no fun but it's made much easier by the addition of a "stiffness slider" that let's you use a slider which causes D Sculpt to help you identify the edge boundaries of the photograph. After you've gone through the photography, and dot patter matching and outlining process you can generate the mesh. On the bottom of the interface is a "P" and "M" for the two major modes. Photo mode and Model mode. Photo mode is where you do the outlining and pattern matching. Model mode is where you manipulate the model in 3D and refine the mesh. Also in Model mode you can adjust the rendering of the 3D object to display a solid object, flat or smooth shading. A particularly nice feature is a slider that let's you control the density of the triangular mesh. You can use this to generate levels-of-detail for use in your run time delivery system. The following images illustrate teapots with progressively reduced numbers of polygons. The first contains 3000, then 1002, 504 and finally 105 triangles. An equally important feature is the ability of the system to extract a texture map from the photographs. The original texture of the object is preserved and is mapped onto the mesh resulting in a photographic quality end product, the 3D model that looks like the real thing. Finally when you're all done D Sculptor has a rich set of export file formats such as: Direct 3D, DXF, Java (compressed Java graphics .cjg), VRML 2.0, Wavefront (.obj), JPG, BMP, TIFF. The D Vision Works web site contains a number of example screen shots illustrating a D Sculptor mesh used in Maya and Bryce. Happy modeling and may your meshes be efficient and all your polygons coplanar.
Two cemeteries in Washington County are prime examples of the wealth of history that graveyards can hold -- and the hard work required to maintain it. Amid the hubbub of shopping centers and the din of traffic from nearby Hwy. 61, the cemetery sandwiched between McDonald's and Tires Plus seems jarringly out of place. Few pause to notice the prim patch of well-tended green, bounded by an iron fence, that holds some of Cottage Grove's earliest pioneers. The cemetery, designated a historic site by the Washington County Historical Society, has ties to the founders of Mars Inc., the giant candy manufacturing company. Across the county, another cemetery lies hidden along a gravel road on one of the steep hillsides above Afton. It also holds many of that city's pioneers. Among them are several Civil War veterans, including one known as "the fighting reverend." Lonely and forlorn, ravaged by vandals and threatened by encroaching buckthorn and other overgrowth from a nearby woods, it is a cemetery in a battle for its life. Though Atkinson Cemetery in Cottage Grove and Mount Hope Cemetery in Afton are of the same vintage, historic significance and background, their fates have taken decidedly contrasting turns. The status of Minnesota's historic cemeteries is reflected in these two graveyards. There are more than 4,000 cemeteries and farm burial grounds in Minnesota; many are abandoned or under threat of vandalism and neglect, their history forgotten. "I would call it a significant problem," said Bonnie McDonald, executive director of the Minnesota Preservation Alliance. In 2002, the alliance placed Mount Hope Cemetery on its Top 10 list of most endangered historic sites in the state. The cemetery had been abandoned, and Washington County was considering the site as a location for a new radio tower, McDonald said. Since then, the graveyard has been removed from the endangered list: the county placed its antenna elsewhere because the city's title to the cemetery land was unsettled. While that may be good news in the short term, McDonald said, Mount Hope still faces the same problems as other historic cemeteries across the state. "Reinvesting or donating money to preserve cemeteries is a harder sell" compared to buildings, McDonald said. "It takes people." Two people, E. Katie Holm and Ken Martens, have taken a special interest in two of Washington County's oldest graveyards, and their work insures that the cemeteries' history won't be lost. It's not just dry dates and facts, but poignant stories of pioneer lives. Helped by a grant from the Independent Feature Project, Holm, a Minneapolis writer and photographer, spent about a year researching and documenting the history of Atkinson Cemetery and the lives of the city pioneers who lie there. For her efforts, she was named the city's preservationist of the year in 2005. "My family has always had an interest in cemeteries and genealogy," Holm said. Specifically, she credits her grandmother for sparking her interest in the stories that cemeteries have to tell. "Cemeteries show the history of each place -- where it started and where it's been," she said. "They show how people care for their memories." The cemetery, Holm found, was probably founded on heartache. John Atkinson had been one of Cottage Grove's first arrivals, in 1846. He founded the Universalist Church, set up a private school in his home and became an early city leader. When his 16-year-old son Martin drowned in 1854, he was likely buried on a parcel of land Atkinson owned. That site grew into the cemetery. In the early 1970s, before the area around it was developed, Atkinson Cemetery had been abandoned for 60 years, so overgrown no one even noticed it was there, Holm said. Once it was rediscovered, the city, joined by families and the city's Lions Club, began major restoration work. Most of the vegetation, save for a majestic oak tree, was removed. Grave markers were replaced, Holm said, but after years of vandalism and lost records, it's not certain that gravestones were put back in their original spots. The effort was aided by Forrest Mars, head of the giant candy company whose family -- inventors of M&Ms and Milky Way and Snickers candy bars -- is from the Newport/Cottage Grove area. A large monument in the cemetery pays tribute to the Mars ancestors, though it's unknown if any are actually buried there. "I would assume there's more people there than there are records for," Holm said. Notably, there is no gravestone for John Atkinson, but it's likely he's somewhere in the cemetery bearing his name. "As far as I know, no one knows where he's buried." Martens, a local historian who is active in the Afton Historical Museum, first visited Mount Hope Cemetery with his father as a boy, in 1967. The pair hiked up the hillside on Halloween day. "And we had to look for it, because there was no improvement here." As with Atkinson Cemetery, the first burials at Mount Hope were in 1854, four years before Minnesota became a state. Among the Civil War veterans buried here, Martens said, is the Rev. Simon Putnam, whose fiery ardor for the Union cause helped recruit dozens ofsoldiers. Many joined the First Minnesota Infantry, the unit credited with turning the tide at the Battle of Gettysburg. "I call him the fighting reverend," Martens said. Putnam, who founded the Congregational Church in Afton and whose house still stands across from the Afton Historical Society Museum, enlisted at age 39, bringing his 16-year-old son Myron along as a drummer boy. The Putnams ended up with the Third Minnesota Volunteers. While fewer than 20 members of the unit died in battle, nearly 300 died of disease. That was the case for both Putnams. The cemetery is actually two distinct areas, Martens said: A Victorian-era cemetery with more ornate stones and formal burial sites and, further into the woods, a primitive burial ground with cruder homemade stones and telltale depressions in the earth with no markings. "It's been lost and forgotten a lot of times, and then rediscovered and lost again," Martens said. There are 33 burials in the newer portion, though archaeologists suspect there could be 100 more. Vandals have made it a frequent target, and their damage is still evident. Buckthorn and other vegetation also are encroaching on the site, despite volunteers who occasionally mow it and Boy Scouts who do frequent cleanups, Martens said. "Nature takes over faster than you can clean it up." Martens has spent much time over the past 40 years poring through records and piecing together the stories of the people buried at the cemetery. "I feel like I'm a detective trapped in a time machine," he said. Partly through his work, there may be hope for Mount Hope Cemetery. The city of Afton is in the process of getting a clear title to the land. Once that's done, the cemetery could get the regular care that it needs, said Ken Johnson, head of the city's Public Works Department. That prospect tantalizes Martens. "There's still mysteries to be solved here," he said. "If we could preserve it, we could probably get to the answers someday."

LA JOLLA, Calif.--(HSMN NewsFeed)--Traversa Therapeutics, Inc., a privately held developer of RNAi delivery technologies, announced today the completion of a $2 million Series A financing led by the San Diego Tech Coast Angels and joined by investors Mesa Verde Venture Partners and Morningside Group. Traversa was founded with technology developed by Professor Steven F. Dowdy, Ph.D., and his research group at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the University of California San Diego (UCSD) relating to siRNA delivery and the induction of RNA Interference (RNAi). “There is a great need for novel short interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery platforms. This technology has shown outstanding delivery characteristics in pre-clinical models, as well as in vitro delivery to nearly all cell types and entire cell populations assayed in a non-cytotoxic fashion. These cell types include primary cells, T cells, B cells, Macrophage, huESC and tumor cells, where other delivery approaches have failed,” noted Dr. Dowdy, co-founder of Traversa. Dr. Francois Ferre, co-CEO of Althea Technologies and lead angel investor, has joined the board. Both Dan Wood of Mesa Verde Venture Partners and Roger Flugel of Sanderling Ventures are board observers. Sanderling Ventures and a Morningside Group entity are limited partners of Mesa Verde Venture Partners. Traversa Therapeutics, Inc. is a La Jolla, California-based biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of RNAi delivery technologies. The company strives to rapidly advance siRNA platform delivery technologies for use internally and by other pharmaceutical companies in targeting a wide variety of acute, chronic and infectious human diseases. Traversa also markets its technology for high throughput RNAi screening applications. San Diego Tech Coast Angels is a group of private investors who invest in and assist early-stage, Southern California companies. It is the San Diego network of the Southern California-based Tech Coast Angels organization, which also has networks in Santa Monica and Newport Beach. Mesa Verde Venture Partners' charter is to invest in a diversified portfolio of early-stage biotechnology and medical technology companies in the southwest. Areas of focus include drug discovery/tools, medical devices and diagnostics and healthcare information technology. Mesa Verde Venture Partners is the successor fund to IngleWood Ventures of San Diego. Sanderling is the lead investor behind Mesa Verde Venture Partners. Morningside Group (www.morningside.com) is a diversified investment group founded in 1986 by the Chan family of Hong Kong. It is engaged primarily in private equity and venture capital investments. The group has investments in North America, Europe, across Asia-Pacific, and since 1992, in Mainland China. Morningside Group was one of the earliest institutional investors in China's internet industry and in recent years has been an active investor in China's emerging biotechnology sector.
"Pare, you're so thin!" I greeted my friend this afternoon. What happened? Turns out my friend started exercising this year -- 20 minutes on the treadmill on weekdays, 45 on weekends. Every. Single. Day. Why the sudden need to be athletic? He was surprised to find out that his blood pressure was 160 over something. I got scared when I found out that even though he had such high blood pressure, he didn't feel that anything was wrong with him. He actually felt good (except for a stuffy nose, but that was it). So how'd he bring it down to a respectable 120/80? Nope, not medication. Just exercise (lots of walking) and a sensible diet. Which reminds me of those P.E. classes about maintaining 60% to 80% of your Maximum Heart Rate for about 30 minutes. Remember that thing about 220 minus your age? Anyway, there's another Max HR formula that deals with your age and 5% of your body weight in pounds. It's called The Best Fit Formula for computing your maximum heart rate. Okay. Enough typing in front of the computer. It's time to walk around more. See ya!
"Bill Eger is a flight attendant who has suffered from debilitating back pain on and off for 15 years. After just three SLM Bodywork sessions he is functioning like a normal person again and is so impressed he has signed up to do the SLM therapist training, initially as a part time job and then full time as he retires from flying in the coming years." "My career as a World Champion Boxer was destined to be cut short by hand problems before I discovered SLM. I had consulted some of the best surgeons, physiotherapists, chiropractors, acupuncturists and massage therapists for help but none could relieve my pain and keep me fighting until I found Steve Lockhart and SLM Therapy." Three times World Boxing Champion. "Steve thanks for all the miracles you have performed for me this year, without them I would have never have won the World Cup." For almost a year I struggled with a nagging groin injury that seemed as difficult to diagnose as it was to treat. After countless visits to anyone with a different perspective and method of treatment for this enigmatic injury, my girlfriend sent me to Steve Lockhart. He not only addressed and removed imbalances in my body (allowing me to move strongly, securely and painlessly once again), but educated me on how to prevent them from plaguing me in the future. Steve has given me an extra 5-6 years of work in a demanding industry. "After suffering a mountain climbing accident my lower back become a chronic problem. I had many treatments from Chiropractors, Physiotherapists and Osteopaths all to no avail. I felt that the exact nature of the injury and consequent symptoms were overlooked. No one even came close to Steve's ability in reading the body and feeling the knotted spasms in the muscles, providing instant relief. Steve was able to diagnose and then correct this imbalance. For those with any type of injury , weather muscular or joint, I would not hesitate to send them straight to Steve. SLM has been the difference of regaining my previous strength, flexibility and peace of mind. He has also assisted greatly in strengthening my core muscle group and provided welcome advice on how nutrition helps the rehabilitation process." "As a former National Track and Field Athlete I incurred an injury which I sought treatment for over a period of 5 years. I supposedly saw the best of the best- physiotherapists, acupuncturists, sports doctors, massage therapists, alternative therapists and so on. After years of running around and spending thousands of dollars no one could help my injury. I saw Steve intensively for just one month and he not only understood the dynamics of my injury he worked to alleviate my pain in this short period of time. And the results have lasted. I recommend Steve as the most knowledgeable and talented massage therapist I know. He is in tune with the body, passionate about his work and dedicated to fixing any problem you have. A truly amazing healer!" "When Dave ruptured the disc at L4/ L5 in his lower back the top neurosurgeon and physiotherapist he saw told him there was no way he could avoid surgery as his injury was as bad as they had seen. Desperate to avoid the knife he chose SLM Bodywork and 4 months later he is well on the way to a full recovery, back at work and improving every week. The doctors now cannot believe his improvement in such a short time, see for yourself." I am sure you would agree if I could help Dave fix a ruptured disc and avoid surgery then I can help you with your back problem. "Deborah was having lots of problems sleeping with her back pain which came on after she broke her rib. She had been suffering for 8 weeks before she had her first SLM treatment and hasn't looked back. Just wanted to let you know how excited I am about the results I am getting from your program. I have had really terrible sciatica pain for a year and have tried physio, acupuncture, osteo, chiropractic and various other remedies all with no results, until I got your book and DVD. I started the SLM Yoga exercises about three weeks ago and started noticing improvement within days and now some days are completely pain free. I am looking forward to a complete recovery soon. I was getting really desperate for some relief from the pain until I found your program on the internet.Thank you so much. I commenced Steve's program on 5th December, 2006 with the objective of correcting a long standing pelvic imbalance. I experienced an immediate relief in several tight, painful areas after the first session, and by week three, my pelvis had rotated forward and my 1cm leg discrepancy was almost corrected. Steve's program contains the most coherent, constructive advice and self-help treatment plans I have ever found on this subject. I am delighted with my progress so far, and am highly motivated to continue. I encourage others who want to help themselves to use this program as a path to regaining wellness. Graduate Certificate Infection Control FRCNA (Ret'd). Just wanted to say a quick thank you for your Self-Treatment program. I have been using this for about about a month and have noticed a big improvement all round! I was being treated by a chiropractor for a workplace injury I sustained some 12 years ago. My pelvis was unaligned causing fairly severe pain over the past few years. Anyway I received your self-treatment program and am thrilled. I have much more mobility on a day to day basis, as well as essentially non-existent pain (comes and goes, but greatly reduced). When a feeling of soreness or stiffness comes, I pop down onto the floor, do some SLM Yoga and the pain is gone. Thank you so much! I have followed your DVD conscientiously nearly everyday, and have benefited quite noticeably- better posture, stronger muscles and therefor better spinal support resulting in freedom from pain and more mobility.I keep reading portions of both books as there is such a lot of practical information in them both. My scenario is- am 74, suffered a lumbar disk lesion about 40 years ago, and, to avoid surgery, spent some weeks in traction. Have consulted many chiropractors and various therapists with (as you would expect) only marginal results, and, really have learnt mainly by painful experience what I can and cannot do, and am really grateful that eventually I came in contact with you. I've been in trouble with my back for almost 4 years & have only recently been able to function again socially, dress myself etc. I still can't put my own shoes on, or look after my own hygiene properly without my husbands assistance. I haven't launched completely into the program, but I have been using the SLM Yoga now for several weeks once a week. My first reaction to using the SLM Yoga, is that it is so........ easy to do. I have always found stretching to be hard work for so little gain, but the SLM Yoga technique feels good while I'm doing it. It just feels right. The biggest problem I have is muscle spasms in the QL's, & it feels fantastic to actively isolate them and work on them. Not to mention how great it feels in every other tight part of my body. (Which by the way is everywhere from my neck to my toes) In the last two weeks I've discovered also that by doing the SLM Yoga workout after I have a flare up (which is at least once every few weeks that I go into Spasm & irritate the disc in L5/S1), that the technique relaxes the spasms & minimizes the effects of the flare up. So I get back on track much quicker. I've also passed you web link on to two work colleagues who have recently developed problems with their back. I recommend it highly to people. I strongly believe in your theory in relation to muscle imbalance. It just makes a lot of sense to me & has helped me make sense of what is going on in my body. I used to participate in competitive sport, specifically, alot of cycling. I have had a 'bad back' for years, but always dismissed it as just something I have - and then, after a significant injury 2 years ago (snowboard related), I thought I would never cycle again. I was on the floor for weeks at a time, in pain, unable to move. After considering as many options as I could and visiting many different therapists, Myotherapy proved to be the most helpful. Still with the occasional day with a crook back, I was eager to try the SLM Yoga system. The benefit was immediate: from being on the floor to sitting up and capable of moving about - after just one session. After practising the

Incorporating your business transforms it into a legal entity separate from you, capable of starting a lawsuit, buying property or even committing crime. Of course, the decision to incorporate depends on your business and your needs and it isn’t right for every business. Business owners who do decide to incorporate gain many potential benefits, including lability protection, a range of tax benefits and an easier time getting financing and investors. To help you decide if incorporating is in your best interest, here’s an easy comparison of the pros and cons. Limited liability protection. This is probably the biggest reason many small businesses end up incorporating, whether they incorporate in Delaware or the state in which they operate. As long as you operate your company according to the laws and regulations set in place, your corporation becomes a legal entity of its own with its own separate debts and liabilities. You can’t be held personally responsible for the corporation’s debts if it becomes unable to pay debts or liabilities, even after a lawsuit. With a partnership or sole proprietorship, on the other hand, personal assets may be seized to pay off the debts from the business. A range of tax benefits. Corporations are taxed at a significantly lower rate than individuals, although it’s important to remember there are a few types of companies, each with different tax structures. With a C corporation, for example, only the first $50,000 of the company’s taxable income is taxed at 15%, compared to an individual who may be taxed up to 27%. Salaries, employee bonuses, education benefits, health insurance benefits, dependent care assistance and more are also fully deductible, whereas many things are only partially deductible by a partnership or sole proprietor. Easier access to investment capital. Incorporation usually gives you more flexibility in terms of raising capital. You won’t need to actually borrow money anymore and pay interest; instead, you can choose to sell stock or equity interests. Investors are much more interested in investing after you’ve incorporated. Your business lives on. For some, the idea that their company can live on after they pass is a strong incentive to incorporate. With a partnership or a proprietorship, the company disappears when the owner dies. Corporations, on the other hand, will keep going on. Of course, everything has it’s disadvantages, including incorporating your business. There are three primary things you should consider before you make your decision. Complex rules and laws. Forming a corporation can be challenging, although the real work is the maintenance. Corporations must remain in good standing by filing the necessary paperwork, keeping detailed records and through proper accounting. Failure to follow the established rules and you can lose your liability protection or incur hefty fees. Possible double taxation. Depending on how you incorporate, you may face double taxation when the company’s profits are first taxed as income to the company and then as income to the shareholders once it’s distributed in the form of dividends. You can avoid this by forming an LLC or electing the S corporation status — provided you meet qualifications. Advice is usually necessary. During the incorporation process, you may choose to hire a corporate service company like USA Corporate Services to help you choose the right entity based on your business type and then file the necessary paperwork. Once your company is incorporated, you’ll also want to get professional advice and guidance to make sure your business stays complaint.
I'm thinking of applying for a BSc with QTS, but I have already completed 2 years of a BSc Chemistry degree. If I do not complete my Chemistry degree, are my current credits transferable so that the course length is shortened or would I have to complete the full 3 years of the BSc with QTS? You are unlikely to be able to shorten the length of the teaching course. You should think very carefully about withdrawing from the Chemistry course if you are more than half way through. Talk to your tutors. They may be able to help you. You could do a one year PGCE after a three year Chemistry course and qualify earlier than stopping the BSc and re-starting on a BEd. You now need to take advice from parents, counsellors at Southampton, course tutors. Russian wife of British Citizen, doing PGCE, will I get a bursary? I am interested in the teaching course for adults and would be very grateful for any advice you can give me?
Not exactly. Discrepant checksums mean only that the file has changed. As well as data corruption it can mean that file was changed deliberately. For example: when you have edited and saved a document, the records in data base have changed, or the new records have been added. So you can also use FastSum to identify the list of changed files. It is useful when you need to synchronise a large amount of files between different locations. For more information about the receiving the changed files list see the Documentation.
I have graduated and moved to University of Texas at Austin. You can still reach me via emailrudi@robot-learning.de. Rudolf Lioutikov joined the Intelligent Autonomous System lab on November, 1st 2013 as a Ph.D. student. His research includes imitation-learning, skill learning, motion segmentation and human-robot interaction for non-experts. During his Ph.D., Rudolf worked on the 3rd Hand Project where he developed and evaluated new approaches in the field of semi-autonomous human-robot collaboration tasks. Combined, the developed methods form an imitation learning pipeline. The Probabilisitic Segmentation (ProbS) method segments initially unlabeled demonstrations are segmented into sequences of movement primitives, while simultaneously learning a library of primitives. ProbS is an Expectation Maximization method, where the E-step computes a new segmentation of the demonstrations given the current model and the M-step learns a new model given the current segmentation. The model is defined as a mixture of primitives. The segmented demonstrations and the learned primitive library are used to induce a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar for primitive sequencing. The grammar structure is learned using an Markov chain Monte Carlo optimization, where a novel prior based on three Poisson distributions was introduced. The induced grammar serves as an easily comprehensible representation of the capability of a robot with respect to the primitives learned from the demonstrations. The grammar can now be used to generate new sequences of primitives from the library. Finally, the induced grammar is improved through reinforcement learning approaches in order to improve the grammar such that previously unseen tasks can be solved by the grammar and the primitive library. Before his Ph.D., Rudolf completed his Master Degree in Computer Science at the Technische Universitaet Darmstadt focusing on robotics and machine learning with a minor in bionics. In his masters thesis Rudolf investigated robust and safe policy search methods under the supervision of Gerhard Neumann and Jan Peters. He developed a new policy update approach entitled Information Theoretic Stochastic Optimal Control. Rudolf is also looks into approaches for anticipatory robot behavior, active learning for human-robot interactions, infusing semantic meaning into learned movement grammars, task and role identification in collaborative human-robot scenarios and robot-assisted learning of human motor skills. Another big interest of Rudolf is the application of machine and robot-learning methods in prosthetic devices. Such intelligent prostheses could improve the adaptation process, the capabilities and the quality of life of the respective person.

READ BEFORE BIDDING Budget less than $100, maybe a little bit higher but do not waste time sending me a $150+ offer. Hi, I am looking for someone to build a custom script that will allow me to enter the amount of boxes per item and the size. This item must also be able to work with all my other plugins and have no conflicts. I must also be able to specify the amount of items fit in each box. Amount of boxes Amount of items that fit per box (using the cart amount). Any overflow goes another box. It should not interfere with products that are already entered. Meaning i do not want all products to all of a sudden stop working because this is installed. I also need to be able to set an oversize handling fee. So there would be an area that i would just select yes and i would enter a fee of example $12 to be added to the order. I would either automatically add in the shipping price or just add as a seperate cart fee (like above taxes and sub total). I also need this to be based on quantity, example it would add this fee every 1-4 quantity, meaning if they order 5, it would be $12x2. Just to clarify something, i should be able to setup multiple package sizing and estimated price received back. Like one box is 2x4x5 @ 5lbs and other is 96x4x10" @ 14lbs See screen shot that shows example. You are also required to provide support for any updates. Who ever wins this i have another project after for custom price matrix.

The American Civil War began in South Carolina on April 12, 1861, when Confederate batteries in Charleston Harbor opened fire on Fort Sumter; the first shots fired in a war that would claim over 600,000 American lives. The State of Connecticut did not falter in its support of the federal government. Over 55,000 young men from Connecticut served in uniform during the war. Connecticut industry supplied the armed forces with firearms from the Colt Firearms Company and many independent contractors produced a plethora of weapons. Approximately 10% of the Connecticut men who served in the war died while in service, over 2,000 of them in battle. Almost 700 Connecticut soldiers died in Confederate prisons. The women of Connecticut stood by their men at war by creating Soldiers Aid Societies. The Hartford Ladies Aid Society was one of the largest in the nation during the war. The men serving from Connecticut were present at nearly every major engagement of the war from the First Battle of Bull Run to Appomattox. Connecticut regiments fought with distinction at Antietam, Drewry’s Bluff, and Cold Harbor. As with the nation itself, Connecticut’s bloodiest day came on September 17, 1862, at Antietam, Maryland. The sacrifices of Connecticut men and women can be witnessed firsthand in the collections of the Connecticut Historical Society. View the diary of Sergeant Samuel Grosvenor of the 16th Connecticut Regiment and learn of his trials and suffering during a 7-month imprisonment at Andersonville. Read the words of Major Edward Blake’s family, who were in search of their lost son after his disappearance in battle in Virginia. Witness the affection, hope, and dreams for the future of couples like Frederick Lucas and Jennie Wadhams, or John Best Cuzner and Ellen “Nell” Sperry.

The 50-level hotel and residential tower will be built for Melbourne's ICD Property, a developer known for its passion for innovative and forward-thinking design. Woods Bagot Principal, Peter Miglis says the building couldn't exist anywhere else. "Inspired by New Zealand's extraordinary geology and fauna, this will be a simple, confident building form on the city skyline that also provides a companion to the existing Sky Tower. "Sightlines to culturally significant landmarks, the height of the streetscape, pedestrian connectivity to key destinations and Auckland's weather have all been carefully considered to create a structure that could only sit within this particular location. "We see this building, on this site, as an important moment to add a defining piece of architecture to Auckland's cityscape." Richard Goldie, Director of Peddle Thorp explains that the building's lower level has been designed to fit the future vision for its surrounds in the city. "Federal Street is already a 'destination' for the public within Auckland's CBD and that will only be enhanced through its transformation into a pedestrian-focussed laneway. A building's character at street level is as important as its impression on the skyline." The lobby to the hotel is located at the top of a podium, freeing the lower street levels to be highly public focussed. A key feature will be a ground level marketplace offering the finest New Zealand food and beverage. Elevating the 'sky lobby' also gives the public an opportunity to enjoy the building and city from another aspect. The 180-metre-tall building will occupy a 1600 square metre site at 65 - 71 Federal St, between Victoria and Kingston Streets, just to the north, seaward side of the Sky City complex. Only a few metres shorter than Auckland's tallest planned development, the Seascape in Customs Street (also designed by Peddle Thorp), the tower will combine retail space, a hotel with more than 200 rooms, investor apartments and owner occupier penthouse suites. "The building's orientation towards the ocean is a unique gesture that speaks to our place in the Pacific," says Richard Goldie. The design features the extensive use of timber in its public spaces which again is a strong expression of place. "Our major civic buildings, the Auckland Museum and Auckland Art Gallery both use timber to stunning effect. It's the material with which we privilege our most significant buildings." And the winning design is notable for its respect of the Sky Tower. "The Sky Tower is the primary marker that locates the city centre. Our design respects the Sky Tower, in the way we respect 'first arrivals'. We do this by ensuring our building protects views to the horizon from the Sky Tower's observation deck. "The brief called for a scheme complying with a floor surface ratio of 13:1, and another at 18.5:1. We recognised that to achieve the higher number we would need to achieve Auckland Council's vision of 'design excellence'. "Our solution delivers exemplary design combined with public amenity. We believe this kind of thinking is what Aucklanders expect and deserve when it comes to the architecture of our significant buildings," says Richard Goldie. The building will be green-rated to the highest possible level with an embedded power network. Parking will all be underground, while above the hotel there will be apartments for rent and lease with the top 15 floors being luxury owner occupier apartments. The tower will be clad in curtain wall glass - a glazing system with aluminium mesh between the panes of double glazing to improve the building's performance acoustically and structurally. With open balconies not possible at high levels because of the wind strength, inside conservatory winter gardens with angled façade panels will provide the feel of an outdoor environment. The development, which is expected to cost around $200 million should be completed by the end of 2022.

The UPSC civil services exam, considered one of the toughest exams in the country is attempted by lakhs of people. Out of them, only a tiny fraction emerges successful after the long-drawn process concludes. The IAS exam is so rigorous that the toppers generally create much curiosity every year. Aspirants are eager to know the toppers’ mark. So, we bring you IAS toppers’ marks in all the subjects in the civil services exam. UPSC सिविल सर्विस में सफल उम्मीदवारों के अंक (हिंदी में) : यहाँ क्लिक करें ! Union Public Service Commission or UPSC has declared the final result of IAS 2017-18 as of today.

The Civil Services Main Examination is the second stage of the Civil Services Exam. Only those candidates who clear IAS Prelims are eligible to sit for IAS Mains. It comprises 9 papers, out of which marks for only 7 are taken into consideration while preparing the merit list & the remaining 2 are merely qualifying in nature. Each candidate who is eligible for taking the Main Examination has to choose an optional subject, in addition to General Studies & Essay Paper, which are mandatory for all candidates. The Civil Services Exam is considered to be the mother of all exams. The syllabus is very vast and each part of the syllabus calls for a detailed strategy which may be unique for each candidate. However, Onlinetyari has set out a new initiative wherein we guide IAS aspirants by providing detailed strategies to tackle the IAS Exam. As per UPSC, the General Studies papers are so designed as to test the general awareness of a candidate on a variety of subjects. These subjects have been so chosen that they would be relevant for a career in the Civil Services. The nature & standard of questions asked would be such that a candidate would need no specialized study to answer them. The Civil Services Mains exam calls for simply a basic understanding of issues that are relevant to the exam. What this essentially means is that, you have to be aware of the issues that are relevant from the exam point of view and know certain basics around them. Since, there are issues too many, you can not afford to get into the details of all of them. IAS Mains syllabus would come in handy here. Always remember to go through the UPSC Syllabus while you prepare. Merely remembering facts around the issues is not sufficient. Candidates must be able to analyze those events in context of the larger picture. All candidates besides knowing and analysing issues must also have the ability to form their own opinion around them. This is very critical to your scores in the General Studies Papers. As a candidate, you would have to look at all issues from a very balanced perspective. You can not afford to have a partisan approach. While framing your opinions, it is always advised that you must weigh both the pros and cons and then come to a conclusion. How to crack General Studies for IAS Mains? All those candidates who give relevant, meaningful and succinct answers to the questions asked are likely to score better than the rest. UPSC is very serious around the Word Limits that are predefined for each question. Besides, the number of questions that are asked in the General Studies Paper is also a lot. Thus, there is a time constraint that you need to take care of. So, remember, as an IAS aspirant, you do not need to have a doctorate in each of the subjects that are a part of IAS Mains syllabus to crack General Studies for IAS Mains. Just make sure you read the question well, write only relevant & succinct answers, present them wonderfully.

Rodriguez’s murder topped a spectacularly violent week, in which victims in public thoroughfares were shot during peak business hours, businesses were firebombed and the bodies were dumped with intimidating messages in public places. El Diario de Juarez journalist Armando Rodriguez Carreon was well-known for countless stories about gangland killings in his hometown of Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua. For years, the 40-year-old police beat reporter tirelessly published pieces about the latest executions in a violence-torn city. Rodriguez launched his journalistic career as a technician and photographer for the Ciudad Juarez Channel 44 television station before moving into print during the early 1990s. His newspaper career closely paralleled the violent rise of the Juarez drug cartel and the women’s slayings that became known worldwide as femicides. Popularly known as “El Choco,” Rodriguez was among the first reporters to write about the discoveries of raped and slain women on the outskirts of Ciudad Juarez. Rodriguez’s stories, which relied a lot on police sources and often did not implicate any particular suspects, were characterized by an almost matter-of-fact quality that kept to the narrative even as violence kept escalating. On Thursday morning, Nov. 13, Rodriguez became a victim himself when he was shot outside his home by a gunman who reportedly fled in a waiting car. No possible motive for the homicide was publicly disclosed, but it was reported that Rodriguez received a text threat on his cell-phone earlier this year. His killing occurred one week to the day that a severed human head was discovered at a monument to journalists in Ciudad Juarez. Local media, government officials and Mexican and international journalist organizations quickly condemned Rodriguez’s killing, which carried the trademark of organized crime. Numerous public commentaries about the murder were posted on news websites in Ciudad Juarez and neighboring El Paso. The Rodriguez slaying was covered on the Nov. 13 prime-time newscast of the U.S.-based Spanish language television network Univision, which reaches millions of viewers. Rodriguez’s murder topped a spectacularly violent week in Ciudad Juarez and the state capital of Chihuahua City four hours down the highway to the south. Incidents included the gunning down of victims in public thoroughfares during peak business hours, the firebombing of businesses and the dumping of murdered bodies with intimidating messages in public places. The Rodriguez murder also came amid a new wave of threats and pressures against the Ciudad Juarez press. For instance, CEPET reported that the Ciudad Juarez daily El Mexicano was the target of intimidation by individuals purporting to be agents of the Chihuahua state attorney general’s office last week. According to CEPET, a state police officer identified as “Perez” and accompanied by other men in official vehicles strolled into the newspaper’s office Nov. 4 and demanded to interrogate columnist Mario Hector Silva about sources the writer used in a story. When informed that Silva was not on the premises, the officers allegedly grew angry, threatened other employees and threw a photographer’s camera in the trash. With the Rodriguez killing, at least six journalists have been murdered in Mexico this year so far. Other victims include Oaxaca radio announcers Teresa Bautista Merino and Felicitas Martinez Sanchez, Tabasco radio man Alejandro Zenon Fonseca Estrada, Michoacan newspaper director Miguel Villagomez Valle, and Chihuahua writer David Garcia Monroy. An international observer mission spearheaded by the Committee to Protect Journalists, Article 19, Open Society Institute and other press advocacy organizations traveled to Mexico this year to investigate conditions confronting journalists. Despite legal reforms, the mission concluded that Mexican journalists are in dire circumstances due to violence, impunity and governmental indifference. Most of the 2008 journalist murders, as well as earlier cases like the 2006 murder of U.S. journalist Brad Will in Oaxaca, remain unsolved and unpunished. In a statement issued on November 11, Will’s family and lawyer took strong issue with the contention of the Office of the Federal Attorney General (PGR) that the documentarian’s killers are in custody. Criticizing the arrests of anti-government activists for the murder, the Will family said the PGR ignored forensic evidence and eyewitness accounts that point to pro-government paramilitaries and public officials as the probable killers. Only hours after Armando Rodriguez was murdered, the PGR informed the Mexican media that the same special unit assigned to investigate the Will homicide was looking into the killing of the Ciudad Juarez journalist. — El Diario de Juarez November 13, 2008. — Newspapertree.com, November 13, 2008.

Best Friend just called to ask if I was cold. He was still stuck on the weather which possibly meant he was stuck with that mood. I played it safe. I was always cold, writes Upala Sen. Best Friend left on an official trip for an “indefinite period”. Now he is the sort who starts feeling homesick the moment he steps out of south Delhi. So when he called to enquire about the weather “back home” (he had been away for two days) I decided to indulge him. The hot dude was away, so the mercury had plummeted in grief — I thought he could do with some extra niceness. Response: Grunt. I dropped the cute act and then asked him matter-of-factly if he had reached home. What I meant was, had he left office? But no sooner were the words out of my mouth than he bit my head off. “This is not home. This is a house, just a guest house.” Ouch! What did I say? Mercifully for my self-esteem bbsonline.org says that the words children use are words children hear, and not so much the words they prefer. Point to be noted. Likewise, I would get confused between home and house. According to mtannoyances.com (the full name is mother tongue annoyances) home is “anywhere you live -- your home may be a mobile home or an igloo” whereas, a house is “a physical structure with walls and a roof and a door”. I would think the difference goes deeper, where words lose their efficacy. The other day we were at a photoshoot. The model was friendly and as she wielded those makeup brushes with Van Gogian élan we chatted. “I am from New York,” she told us. It sounded crisp and smart and…to the point, 'Nu York' (as she put it) or for that matter New Delhi or Bombay. Take a peek into wordlab.com, it is full of exotic place names. And to think whenever I was asked where I was from I had to say Bandel. No, I have no problems owning up that I am a small-towner, but the name of my small town is undeniably a phonetic horror. So sometimes I mentioned the nearest city, at other times the state, and for the really really insistent I took a lesson in map pointing before I gave out the name. Till one day, for a change, someone asked me what my home town was like. And that got me thinking. Let's see: birthday parties with oily chips and return gifts, a magnolia tree outside my room, a-rupee-a-ride cycle rickshaws, early morning squatters dotting the Hooghly… Bandel was interminable childhood, certainly not worth sacrificing at the altar of phonetics. Besides, as per msgboard.snopes.com there are people who live in places called Gayville and Bitsch. We had shifted house five times when we were in Bandel. Come to think of it they were all homes. Some years back I was taking the Blueline from Tughlagabad to Dwarka, when a friend called. I had just moved to the city and was still feeling unsettled. And when she hung up abruptly with a “there’s someone at the door” it occurred to me that here I had no door of my own. I never mixed up those words again. And soon after I moved into a home.

In the mid 1980s the Office of Public Archaeology excavated a series of sites in Clear Creek Canyon in central Utah in advance of I-70 construction. A tip by a local resident resulted in the discovery and subsequent complete excavation of a massive Fremont Village, later labeled Five Finger Ridge. In addition, excavators sampled or fully excavated a series of shelters and other residential Fremont sites in the canyon. The abundance of new data and rich artifact yield led directly to the establishment of Fremont Indian State Park across the canyon. This book relates the history of this work and presents the findings of the research. Joel C. Janetski is professor of anthropology at Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah. His publications include Indians of Yellowstone, The Ute of Utah Lake, and Hunter-Gatherer Archaeology in Utah Valley. 4. What Was Learned on the Clear Creek Archaeological Project?

Minergate, one of the largest multi-currency mining pools, has recently added the Ethereum mining feature to its mining client. The main idea behind Minergate is the ease of use and approachability for amateur miners, without any associated drawbacks for professionals. Variable difficulty, a defining feature of the pool, adapts the difficulty to the power of a user’s CPU/GPU, which allows for efficient mining even on some weaker equipment. Minergate was launched in 2014 by a team of cryptocurrency enthusiasts. It consists of more than 100,000 active users mining a number of cryptocurrencies - Monero, Bytecoin, Bitcoin, and now Ethereum. Solo miners and pools alike have been mining Ethereum since the generation of its Genesis block on 30 July 2015. The ever-growing popularity of the coin has reached an unprecedented height, when it hit $1B market capitalization in March 2016. It is no wonder that there are many people out there who would like to join in on the profits from the nascent industry: the total hashrate of Ethereum network is estimated to be 2.4TH/s and growing, with most of that amount spread across several major pools. As it was with Bitcoin, the popularity of the cryptocurrency is creating nigh-impregnable barriers to entry for independent non-professional miners. Even now, the GeForce GTX 960, one of the most popular GPUs, would have to mine Ethereum for about 5 months before it just breaks even, and the difficulty is only expected to increase. What that means is that the focus will gradually shift towards mining pools, which allow their members to join resources and thus increase the predictability of the gains, as opposed to relying on luck while mining solo. It is for that reason that the pool’s GUI miner has been one of the most simple to use in the industry, with a single-click mining feature. The pool’s developers kept the same idea of accessibility in mind during the implementation of Ethereum mining. Cointelegraph talked to Claude Lecomte, Minergate`s CEO, about the mining industry and Minergate’s new features. According to Lecomte, Minergate has a 1-click GUI miner that eliminates the barriers for entering the mining world. Minergate software doesn’t require configuring the system or studying tutorials. The user downloads the app and clicks “start mining”. This is important as many users don’t know how to deal with console miners, but still potentially have significant mining power. In the case of Ethereum, they are often gamers that usually have powerful graphic cards. Lecomte considers Ethereum “one of the most advanced technologies nowadays.” He considers the secret to its success to be the fact that it isn’t positioned as “modern cryptocurrency” with some “killer features”. It is a blockchain platform that allows for creating value added applications on top of it. Although Minergate’s Ethereum mining feature is targeted to amateur miners, professional miners can successfully connect and efficiently mine on the pool, using console miners, like ethminer, the official Ethereum mining client. Now that Minergate has added Ethereum to their 1-click GUI miner, it is possible to start mining in a couple of seconds and make profits mining on ordinary computers. When it comes to mining pools, a question is often raised about their intrinsic discrepancy with the core philosophy of any cryptocurrency: decentralization. By joining hashrates in massive amounts, pools centralize power, and thus endanger the security of the entire network. Lecomte believes market laws will help to mitigate this threat by providing a better market supply for the growing demand. Lecomte notes that the market is changing rapidly, introducing cryptocurrencies with various underlying algorithms. The protocols can sometimes be improved even in existing coins, which usually affects mining. Still, MinerGate’s job will be focused on driving adoption for the promising technologies by creating the most comprehensive mining services on the market.

While my law practice in Atlanta is focused on representing people who are seriously injured when they are hit by commercial trucks and buses, I get a lot of calls from truck drivers all over the country who are concerned about employers requiring them to drive unsafe equipment or to drive beyond their legal hours of service. Partly to save myself some time on the phone, below the break is a copy of 49 US Code, Section 1536. I don’t personally handle these matters.

Bel Air has typically been able to provide 2-3 teams in this league. Not only will the Bel Air teams play each other, but also against other area rec councils as well. If you are a Sophomore or older playing on your high school's JV baseball team, you will not be eligible to play in this league. In addition, players who play in the spring/summer 2018 on a Club, Tournament, or similar team are not permitted to play. Typically games are played twice each week on Mondays and Wednesdays. Occasionally teams will play on a Sunday night at 6pm in lieu of a Monday game. There are two different ways to register for travel baseball. Register directly for your age group for travel try outs – this is for returning players or new, who are not interested in playing rec. If you’re not selected for the team, you still have the option to play rec, and registration fees will transfer. Register for your age group in rec – this is for the rec player who is potentially interested in trying out. A coach will reach out (and you can reach out too – contacts HERE) and answer any questions you may have. If you are selected for the team, your registration fees will transfer. If you’re in the 13U-17U age groups, those teams operate on a different schedule to not conflict with H.S. Baseball. You will receive information about registration directly from your coach.
Macrolithic technologies for grinding, pounding and otherwise pulverising foodstuffs have their origins in the very earliest of percussive technologies: it is well established that non-human primates use stones in extractive foraging, thus it requires no great leap of the imagination to connect our earliest hominid forebears with this technology as well, and indeed the morphology of the earliest stone tools suggests that they would function suitably as plant-processing tools. And yet ‘grindstones’ (to use a shorthand term) are widespread among human societies even today, particularly in small-scale agricultural groups, to whom the grindstone is an essential domestic object, situated alongside the pot, the spoon and the fire as objects without which we simply cannot do. Were it not for a grindstone, many families in sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, would not eat. The importance of these objects appears to have been constant: in southern Africa, grindstones are ubiquitous on hunter-gatherer sites, and yet paradoxically we know very little about them. Their very ubiquity has rendered them invisible and in archaeology we see them used solely as proxies: they have been variously (and contradictorally) cited in the literature as evidence of behavioural modernity, domestic presence on site, or presence on site of domesticates. My doctoral research aims to interrogate these neglected yet important objects, focussing on items from a 40,000 year occupational sequence at the rockshelter of Ha Makotoko in western Lesotho (southern Africa), using functional analysis (residues and usewear) as well as techno-typological research, in order to understand their full biographies and place in human lifeways. I argue that the grindstone is the most important object to our understanding of the interplay between the ‘gathered’ and the ‘gatherer’. An essential component of this analysis is experimental work and ethnoarchaeology: since we know so little about hunter-gatherer grindstones, I wished to take advantage of the long tradition of agricultural grindstone use maintained in Lesotho to the present day. While bearing in mind questions regarding uniformitarian assumption, there appear to be enough similarities between the use globally and historically of grindstones to warrant a comparison. Creating an experimental suite of grindstones (overseeing every step from raw material provisioning through to use and discard) with the advice and guidance of local Basotho women, I would be able then to compare these examples with the morphologically different archaeological sample from the same geographical region. I based my plan for fieldwork on previous research in the same region, which had both answered and provoked questions on contemporary economic use of gathered resources (primarily plants). Although in principle an uncomplicated task, in reality issues of course arouse: other components of my doctoral work (primarily residue analysis of archaeological grindstones) necessitated my presence in the laboratory in Oxford, and I was unable to spend more than six weeks on fieldwork, which was not long enough to compile the corpus of experimental examples. I was extremely fortunate in finding an excellent Mosotho research assistant, Ms Soldart Khantsi (a recent graduate of the cultural heritage studies programme at the National University of Lesotho) who agreed to help me. Following several months in which I devised a suitable programme of experiments, aided by Soldart’s feedback, Soldart then travelled to her home village along the Sebapala river in the mountains of south-western Lesotho and began to create experimental grindstones with the input of local women (who use grindstones themselves every day of their lives) on local raw materials. Soldart documented her work audiovisually and with written notes, and at the beginning of April 2014 I was able to travel to Lesotho to finish up the experimental work and begin in-situ analysis. Based initially in the university town of Roma, western Lesotho, I travelled south to Quthing district: the unavailability of four-wheel-drive vehicles for rental within Lesotho made things more difficult and so it was that I travelled on dirt roads, up hairpin bends and into the mountains. Arriving with Soldart in her village, Sekhutlong-sa-Lineo, I proceeded to analyse the experimental corpus with a USB microscope, DSLR camera and residue swabs. I was able to see grindstone use in action, observing the way the whole body is used in a skilled and learned way to process various plant materials: to use the language of André Leroi-Gourhan (following Marcel Mauss) the actions and gestures that go to make up the techniques of the body in a societally specific way. Although the techniques of grindstone use are widespread within Lesotho, use in the future will probably be limited due to the advent of mechanised grinders, yet until now the behaviours of use have not been codified either in the academic or lay communities, making the documentation of this living heritage both a privilege and a unique opportunity. Following the stay in Sekhutlong, once back in Roma, I conducted some further experiments fashioning some grindstones more morphologically similar to those found at Ha Makotoko, in order to compare the bodily actions involved: it emerges that hunter-gatherer style grindstones are unsuitable for the kind of high-intensity and high-efficiency grinding permitted by the Basotho-style variants which much provoke questions as to their use and place in hunter-gatherer lifeways. The residue component of my DPhil is designed to explore questions based on these experimentally generated predictions and is ongoing. At this stage I can say that it offers tentative support for the predictions: grinding of wild grasses is established in the Middle Stone Age at Ha Makotoko, but this is relatively low-intensity in nature, unlike contemporary processing of domesticates (primarily maize and sorghum). Apart from creating the experimental corpus, I was also able to collect plant reference material from the area surrounding Ha Makotoko and from Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens in Cape Town: these reference specimens are essential in order to determine the uses of archaeological grindstones, since residue work is carried out on a morphological basis. Although the area around Ha Makotoko has been substantially diminished by the completion of the Metolong Dam (which has flooded the rockshelter itself, ending use of the cave which has lasted over 40,000 years and into the present day) it was possible to obtain samples of a number of edible geophytes. Samples obtained from Kirstenbosch broaden my collection still further as do those kindly provided by a number of colleagues. Without funding from the Horniman Award, none of this would have been possible. Travel alone to southern Africa is prohibitively expensive, but thanks to the RAI I was able to comprehensively complete the fieldwork necessary for my DPhil: the experimental work provides a necessary anchor for the residue and usewear analysis, allowing the generation of predictions which the functional analysis can then verify. I believe that this work will enable me to make a substantial contribution to our understanding of hunter-gatherer lifeways in southern Africa, which for so long has been biased towards the ‘hunted’ end of the spectrum at the expense of the ‘gathered’, a state which is at odds with our understanding of contemporary and historically known hunter-gatherer groups. My DPhil is the first to examine botanical residues of lithic technology in Lesotho, and very much in a minority in southern Africa more generally. It is also among the first to examine grindstone technology (from a functional perspective) within sub-Saharan Africa, which I believe is a key component of the ‘gathered’ part of this lifeway. The coupling of relatively new microresidue techniques in an understudied area, on a very poorly understood class of material culture, is already overturning our understandings of hunter-gatherer lifeways, and the experimental component of this project is an essential part of this. The experimental material is not the only contribution however: the living (often termed ‘intangible’) heritage of daily life in Lesotho and other areas globally is threatened by large scale development and extractive resource projects as well as increased globalisation. Introduction of mechanised processing increasingly diminishes the need for the ancient craft of grindstone use. While it is hoped that this may make life easier for the women who use grindstones today, as use of this technology diminishes (catalysed also by projects which render raw material sources inaccessible – grindstones cannot be obtained from riverbeds 60m under water) so too do the stories, traditions and beliefs that accompany it. Processing and knowledge of wild plants for medicine and food will also decrease and a rich (and far from intangible) part of heritage will be lost. Documenting this heritage while it is still relatively vibrant will not compensate for this loss, but accessibly archiving for both the source communities and academia, can mitigate it to a certain extent.

It is a common feeling among many people: The amount of money one has determines the level of happiness, confidence or energy that person has. That is, with enough or so much money, a person generally tends to be upbeat, gregarious and emotionally stable. And the less money one has, the more depressed, aloof and irritable that person becomes. Well, at least, from experience, this seems to hold true 8 out of 10 times, although there are a few “money-less” people we know who remain content with their lot. But they are the rare exceptions. The National Foundation for Credit Counselling in the US found out that a staggering 79% of people say financial worries make them lose sleep, more than other concerns such as their marriages, kids or job stability. Sleepless people certainly make for unhappy families. That survey just confirmed our previous statistic. Money, of course, is not the true source of happiness or contentment. Financial confidence or power comes from having understood the dynamics of financial principles and the steps by which they can be harnessed for our own benefit. Simply said: Financially powerful individuals have the cunning ability to see and know what needs to be done to turn money to their advantage. There are those who may have gotten so much money, like lottery winners, who never had the slightest idea as to how to manage money and simply go about spending or even investing in some deals but do not know exactly how the entire process of maintaining financial power works. And so these people often end up where they were before, penniless and powerless. But there are a few tips to help the ordinary person to gain a reasonable amount of power over money. Habits influence a major part of how we handle money. What we learned from our homes and from early schooling enhanced or diminished our capacity to make money work for us. Many of us often fall into a financial trap, such as overspending or borrowing to buy luxuries, because we inherited the tendency from somewhere in our past or in our immediate environment. The shame or guilt that arises from falling over and over again into the same trap builds up and yet we feel powerless to cut the cycle. Forgiving ourselves for our inadequacies can lead us to ultimately overcome a bad habit and the guilt that comes with it. Deal with each unproductive habit one at a time. Tell yourself that the shame or guilt it brings Is worse than the actual burden of not having money and feeling powerless. Why carry so much weight emotionally and financially? Solving your financial status will also bring emotional relief. Grab the power by controlling money like it were a slave or tool that it is. If it means getting a menial job so you can pay debts, so be it. As we said, our past determines how we deal with money. There is a pattern in everything that we do: whether in cooking a favourite recipe, going on a vacation or even reading a book. Some prefer to read a real book and not an ebook. Others enjoy doing it in a hammock or on an easy chair. And some read a chapter a day; others finish a book in one sitting. So with how we use money. Some get enough joy gambling a small amount of money regularly. Others gamble away their fortunes. Keep a journal on how you spend money and learn more about yourself than you ever did before. You might find yourself behaving as if you were your mother or father who had certain peculair habits with regard to money. Or, you may have your own unique patterns hard to decipher where you got it but may have arisen during an extremely stressful time in your life. Just as some people started drinking or smoking during a traumatic moment in their past, you could have developed the habit of buying on credit during a time when you felt emotionally down or powerless. Or simply envious of your friend or neighbor. Those “emotional money triggers” are, in general, within your power to eradicate or change to benefit you financially. When everything else fails, you might get some relief from a professional financial adviser. Since we already noticed that our financial habits are closely tied to our emotional conditions, it should convince you to get a financial counsellor, particularly one who understands the psychological motivations that push us to do what we do with our money. Positive money habits do not come by accidents. Children of Chinese businesspeople have to work during summer vacation and derive precious training not just in business management, in general, but in essentially appreciating the real value of money through how it is earned and how it is invested back into a profitable venture. Business people are also good sources of advice, especially if you plan to go into business. The simple joy of being debt-free and having control over your budget can be gained from those who have had the discipline of making money grow or, in other words, building wealth. Creating wealth starts from developing the right money habits. It is never too late to start gaining power over your own life through proper money control.

A jaundiced, dying man was brought to her on a stretcher. It was his last wish that he meet with her and be blessed by her gracious presence. "A lot of artists would not consent to meeting with a dying man," she said, "but I've been through enough in my life that I can relate to people very well. I'm not tough. I'm strong." In her case, tough describes a trait, strong depicts a virtue. Who is this woman who is the object of a dying man's final request? And what has she lived through that has given her such strength? Eilleen Regina Edwards was born on August 28, 1965, in Windsor, Ontario. Her parents divorced when she was just a toddler. Her mother, Sharon, then took Eilleen and the older daughter to live in Timmins, Ontario. There, in this poor mining town about 250 miles north of Toronto, she married an Ojibwa Indian, a father of two boys. The new family of six was reduced to five when Eilleen's older sister left home at 14. Eilleen thus became, in her words, "the older sister by default." The family experienced excruciating poverty and the children learned painfully well what it means to be hungry. Eilleen would take a mustard sandwich to school for lunch. Her indigence made her feel embarrassed and isolated. Tragedy struck when Eilleen was 21. Her mother and stepfather were killed in a head-on collision with a logging truck. The grim and numbing accident left Eilleen with custody of her two teenage siblings and the responsibility for raising them. Catholic poet Thomas Traherne asserted, "A Christian is an oak flourishing in winter." The adversity surrounding Eilleen's life made her strong. She abandoned her first name for the Ojibwa word Shania, which means "I'm on my way." She retained her stepfather's surname, Twain. In this way, she took the name by which her millions of fans know her Shania Twain. She was indeed "on her way." Shania Twain has become one of the most successful female singers in history. She is the first woman to have consecutive albums sell more than 10 million copies in the United States. She has won innumerable awards including the Country Music Association's "Entertainer of the Year" and a Grammy Award in 1999. She was also named the "Most Beautiful Canadian Woman of the Century." Shania has not allowed her fame and wealth to obscure her past hardships or lead her to ignore the hardships of others. Her compassion for others is as strong as she is strong as an individual. During some of her singing tours, she donates proceeds from each of her concerts to local charities that aid hungry children. "My goal," she states, "is to save kids the humiliation, the anguish of feeling inferior." Hers is the compassion that is worthy of the approbation of a St. Augustine. The Bishop of Hippo wrote in his Confessions: "Although he that grieves with the grief-stricken is to be commended for his work of charity, yet the man who is fraternally compassionate would prefer to find nothing in others to need his compassion." In helping to reverse the misfortunes of others, Shania is doing through music what Charles Dickens did through his novels. Her compassion for hungry children has not abated because, as she tells us, "I was that hungry kid." Shania Twain's most personal song is "God Bless the Child," and she has pledged all royalties it earns to children's charities. The original title of the song was less catchy, though more instructive of its message: "Hallelujah, God Bless the Child Who Suffers." The term compassion is commonly misinterpreted in our society to mean pity. The compassionate person, as the word indicates, suffers with the suffering person. And more than that, the compassionate person suffers for the suffering person. Pity causes a person to distance himself from the sufferer. There is no moral union between the one who pities and the object of his pity. Consequently, pity is inclined to end suffering by removing the sufferer. Compassion intuitively understands the redeeming value of suffering. Marie Antoinette, born and raised with an aristocrat's indifference toward the plight of her indigent neighbors, suggested that they "eat cake" when informed that they had no bread. Compassion is formed in the real and heartrending experiences of deprivation. Shania Twain's adversity formed her compassion and her strength, and it is to her honor and credit that it retains priority in her heart far above all the trappings of her extraordinary success.

Love and passion are emotions we all want to feel with someone else. Human beings are social animals who crave affection and the feeling of being special to someone else. No matter how many times love hurts us, we still keep looking for more. With the ending of the old year and the beginning of a new one, it is time to leave any and all heartache and mistakes in the past and prepare yourself for a fresh romance. Astrologers predict that 2018 will be a good year for love all around. Here are the signs and people you’ll need to watch out for based on your birth month. People around you admire your ambition and hard work but the person you’ll fall for in 2018 will serve to remind you that there is more to life than work. They’ll do everything they can to help you achieve your goals but they will also make you relax and care for yourself. This romance will come as a surprise because you’ll fall for a person you’ve already known for quite some time but haven’t viewed in that way till now. They’ll arouse your interest in such a relaxed manner that you won’t realize it till it hits you. They’ll love you for your energy and light but will also help you by encouraging you to express yourself better and take risks at times. After a long time, you’ll meet someone who will want to make you happy. With them, you’ll never have to disregard your own needs like you’ve been doing all this while. This person will want to look after you and do whatever brings you joy without expecting any rewards. You’ll fall for them hard and fast. You’ve always been quite self-aware and sure of your opinions. This intimidates people but now you’ll meet someone who will make you feel like you don’t have to tone yourself down for their sake. Earlier you might have felt a little apprehensive about the way you are always ready to express yourself honestly and at time bluntly but this person will see this as one of your best qualities. You’ve always been someone who’s determined, dedicated and always up and about. Your bucket list is huge and you are constantly traveling. But you need an anchor and in 2018 you’ll meet the person who will help you become grounded. Earlier you’ve always had a feeling that your partner is holding you back from doing your best but now the person you’ll meet will make it seem possible to achieve great things while settling down at the same time. The upcoming year will give you the relationship you’ve dreamed of for a long time. You’ll meet someone kind and caring who never loses your interest or makes you feel restless. This person will be understanding enough to know that underneath all your humor, you’re incredibly vulnerable. They’ll make you feel comfortable enough to open up to them about anything and everything.
The International Police Motor Corporation (IPMC) organises annually the International Police Motor Rally. Each year, the motor rally takes place in a different European country and city and all those who enjoy police motor sports for example; Policemen/women, the Gendarmes, Customs Officials, the Judicial Branch, the National Guard, the Border Police, the Military Police, the Guardia Civil, the Carabinieri, and all executive officials from various countries, provinces, communities and members of the police sports organisations are warmly welcome to participate. Originally, when founded in 1930, only executive officials who owned their own automobiles were allowed to take part at the police motor rally. From 1936-1951, World War II thwarted the meeting of these European executive officials who owned their own automobiles and motorcycles. In 1952, the Austrian police had enough courage to organise the revival of the meeting which had been formerly been banned in 1934. 600 police from 6 nations drove under great strain to Salzburg and reminded the colleagues of the idea founded in Hamburg in 1930; that ideas, friendships, contacts, and the everyday life interest in the lives of the police and their families should be shared across all borders, if only to forget for a few short hours; in order to give fresh impetus. If we look at the 60 international police motor rallies in nearly 80 years, we can see that usually around 1.000 executive officials and their families met together. By now one should, dear reader and dear colleague, have asked oneself - why haven't I joined in yet!? A membership or members subscription, which is common in other organisations and clubs, is not required by the IPMC for taking part at a rally. The International Police Motor Corporation does not compete with other private police organisations. Often, the IPMC motor rallies are organised together with other police organisations. The IPMC is politically neutral and completely independent from other police organisations. Get your announcement for the next meeting and join us with your family for the next IPMC motor rally! We would be more than happy to welcome you at the next police motor rally.

Tehran, Iran, June 23, 2018 - Saber Kazemi served up a treat and sent the home fans wild to help Iran secure another VNL win and send Bulgaria crashing 3-1 (25-22 25-15 23-25 25-14). Kazemi hit four aces in his total of 14 points and with Saman Faezi and Morteza Sharifi hitting 16 a piece, the Iranians had enough healthy contributions from all over the court to shoot down a Bulgarian side who came through a physically testing five set match with Germany on Friday. This deserved victory in front of the fanatical supporters means Igor Kolakovic’s side go into their final game against Germany tomorrow with a 6-8 record in the VNL. Another triumph could see them finish in the top half of the table, a decent return for a side who were pitted against some of the best volleyball sides on the planet but have won plenty of plaudits with some courageous displays. Bulgaria were flattened in the second and fourth sets but showed signs of their quality in a dramatic comeback in the third. Rozalin Penchev finished with 16 points while Nikolay Uchikov scored 13 but it wasn’t enough. The Iranian’s power game - they finished with 53 -46 in the spike count while they also out-blocked and out-served the Europeans who now have a record of 5-9 going into the final day of action ahead of the finals in Lille at the start of July. Fired up by the pumping home atmosphere, Iran raced out of the blocks and stormed ahead 10-3 and although Bulgaria staged a creditable comeback with the score at 24-21, the writing was on the wall for Konstantino Plamen’s team. Kazemi saw one spike blocked at the net but it was left to the excellent Faezi to seal with the deal with his sixth point of the set. You could see the confidence surging through the Iranian ranks and not before long, they had 10 set points in the bag and although the first was saved, a wild serve from Uchikov saw Kolakovic’s men slump 2-0 down and on their way to another straight-sets defeat. Credit to the Bulgarians though. Penchev was able to galvanize the team in a razor-tight third set which could have gone either way with the scores locked at 22-22. Valentin Bratoev served long and Iran were suddenly 23-22 ahead but it was left to Penchev to fire home the winner and give the Bulgarians the set their display deserved. It was Iran though who put their foot on the gas in the fourth and it was fitting that a Kazemi ace, his third of the game, sealed a win which sent their devoted fans home very happy.
It was pretty easy to grow potatoes and lots of fun for the kids to dig them up. I started with some organic, store bought potatoes in various colors. I cut them into small chunks, making sure each piece had at least one potato "eye" - this is where the new potato will sprout. I let them sit out over night so that the skin developed a hard film before planting. Then we planted them in our small planter, which is about two feet deep. I layered them (although I think the deeper ones didn't sprout.) And then watered them weekly. I read online that you can dig for them when the shoots reach a few feet high for small potatoes or dig for them once the shoots have started to die for larger potatoes. I let them grow and grow for seven months (I think?) until the first shoot started to yellow. Then we began to dig. It was like digging for buried treasure. We had no idea how many we would find or how big they would be. This is our harvest. Six very small potatoes!! But I'm still really proud of them. Here they are next to my sunglasses so you can see just how small they are! Breakfast hash browns for one two-year-old, coming right up!! The 2011 Craft Trend Report is in!! It's Official!

The Republican presidential candidate, taking a turn on the world stage, called London's problems with Olympic Games preparation "disconcerting." That prompted Cameron to retort Thursday that doubters would "see beyond doubt that Britain can deliver." And London Mayor Boris Johnson told tens of thousands gathered in Hyde Park: "There's a guy called Mitt Romney who wants to know if we are ready. Are we ready? Yes we are!" A one-term Massachusetts governor with limited foreign policy experience, he is hoping to show voters back home he is ready to represent the U.S. strongly and smoothly at a time of global economic turmoil and security troubles. He also wants to emphasize his own tenure running the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City by attending this year's opening ceremonies. And he hopes to draw subtle contrasts with Obama.

Kimiko Domoto-Reilly, MD, is a neurologist in the UW Memory and Brain Wellness Center, where she diagnoses and treats people with neurodegenerative diseases. She has expertise in frontotemporal degeneration spectrum diseases (FTD), including primary progressive aphasia and the behavioral variant of FTD. In collaboration with ADRC researchers, she studies cases of familial cases of autosomal dominantly-inherited neurodegenerative diseases, in order to better understand the factors influencing variation in age of onset, genetic penetrance, and disease progression. As a faculty researcher on the UW Integrated Brain Imaging Center, she works to develop tau positron emission tomography (tau PET) imaging as a research tool for understanding the role of tau proteins in Alzheimer's disease and FTD. She also leads two clinical trials at the UW: the AVID autopsy study and the Imaging Dementia — Evidence for Amyloid Scanning (IDEAS) Study, which is assessing the clinical usefulness and impact on patient-oriented outcomes of a brain amyloid PET scan that detects amyloid plaques, a core feature of Alzheimer’s disease, in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia of uncertain cause. Dr. Domoto-Reilly also leads the ADRC Outreach, Recruitment, & Education Core's team efforts to raise awareness of Alzheimer’s disease and provide relevant education to community members, particularly to local and reservation-dwelling American Indians.

The university campus was not the real reason as to why I went to Bunkyo, but rather the roller coaster at LaQua which ranks 9th on the 10 tallest steel roller coasters in the world. Wiki already warned me that it is standing but not operating, but I went nonetheless, stared at it, and regret not having tried it while it was still operational. Maybe in the future it would once again be open to the public. What makes it stand out is that section that goes through a wall of LaQua. Before I reached this part of Bunkyo, though, I spent around an hour taking a stroll at the University of Tokyo, as though I belonged. The campus would seem boring at first because the designs of the buildings are rather standard, with little variation from one to the next. All of them seem patterned after some western architectural design that makes you think of Hogwarts at times because of the archways that flow into one another. Yes, I guess that is the right term, it felt ‘western’ as though you were not in Japan. It looks like one of those Ivy League universities you see on TV series from the US. There must be more hidden somewhere in the campus, but the only structure I noted as traditionally Japanese was the gate to the north. What I am not sure of is if the University of Tokyo has other campuses, as there is a specific name for the one in Bunkyo. Perhaps, it is the main campus? Although there were not a lot of people when I was there, one can just feel the academic atmosphere, hmm, reminiscing my university days. I walked the streets as if I belonged in there, which would probably just be a dream in this lifetime because the tuition fee is exorbitant, as well as the living expenses. Maybe if and when I decide to get back to the academe and take it seriously through a master’s degree. For now, I was okay with just feeling the campus as if it were my own. It was a nice and quiet alternative to riding a roller coaster, although I find both very therapeutic. I was not able to get inside one of the buildings. I did not know how access works in that campus, and so I just walked farther to find the roller coaster, which does not seem to be so far from the campus. Lack of better things to do. Exiting through the north gate, I turned left, and reaching the first corner, one would see the tracks of the roller coaster to the far right. Follow that path and you end up at LaQua, which is a big mall a la Greenbelt with open air establishments and some rides (which GB does not have). There is a giant Ferris wheel that must give a commanding view of the city, but the price is around 800 yen, or was it a thousand? No, thanks. The area guarantees a good walking tour because it is connected to the Tokyo Dome, where baseball matches are held. You could find an elevated park connecting the two areas, with some picturesque views from an elevated vantage point. Back to LaQua, they also have a water splash ride similar to EK’s log jam. You can also ride a carousel. Or shop. Next to Tokyo Dome, on the other side of LaQua is a mall amusement park with a mini Anchor’s Away ride, along with some establishments, and arcade gaming, if I am not mistaken.

(Bloomberg) -- After eating the dust of its German rival for past three years, BMW AG is getting a faster start off the line in early 2019. BMW sales rose 2.9 percent in March and were roughly flat in the first quarter, as surging demand for X3 compact crossovers helped the brand surpass Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz. A slump for the small GLA crossover and GLE sport utility vehicle sent Mercedes sales down 9.3 percent for the first three months of the year. Fresh off a year in which it trailed Mercedes by fewer than 5,000 vehicles, BMW ended the first quarter with a luxury sales lead of 2,717 units. Toyota Motor Corp.’s Lexus had the best performance among the top luxury automakers in March, with a jump in RX SUV deliveries pacing an 8.2 percent increase. The brand boosted sales 4 percent in the quarter. Volkswagen AG’s Audi bounced back from a five-month streak of falling deliveries with a 1.1 percent gain in March, driven by the Q5 and Q7 SUVs. Deliveries are still down 3.9 percent so far this year.
